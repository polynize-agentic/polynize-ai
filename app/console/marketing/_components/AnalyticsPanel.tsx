/**
 * THE ANALYTICS PANEL (D66, real since D86, interactive since D87). At the bottom of the engine page
 * and at the bottom of every stream.
 *
 * Marrs: "on the main engine page, where it shows everyone, so it's an aggregation of all those
 * stats. And when you go into each of the streams, each one of those streams has an analytics
 * section also. I think it's always going to be the thing at the bottom, because you don't want to
 * look at that first."
 *
 * THIS FILE IS THE SHELL: the reads its pages hand it, the empty and failed states, and the pull
 * button. Everything that responds to a pointer lives in AnalyticsView, which owns the range, the
 * chart and the hover. The split is the point: an empty or failed pull renders entirely on the
 * server with no client bundle at all, which is the common case on a stream nobody has pulled.
 *
 * THE FORM WAS PICKED BEFORE THE COLOUR, which is the part that usually goes backwards:
 *
 * - Four headline numbers are a KPI ROW of stat tiles. Not a grouped bar chart, which is what four
 *   numbers usually get turned into.
 * - Change over time is a LINE, full width, bucketed by day or by week to suit the range.
 * - Comparing platforms is HORIZONTAL BARS, stacked by stream: magnitude against identity.
 * - Five posts with mixed measures is a TABLE. It is also the panel's table view, so no number here
 *   is reachable only by hovering, and it is one of the relief channels the light-mode contrast
 *   result requires.
 *
 * NETWORKS ARE NEVER TOLD APART BY COLOUR. They carry their own PlatformIcon and their name. Colour
 * is spent on one axis only, which is WHO earned the reach (D87), and only inside this panel.

/**
 * REAL NUMBERS SINCE D86. What changed, beyond the data source:
 *
 * THE DELTA TILES ARE GONE. Every tile used to carry "+12% vs last 12 weeks", which the mock could
 * always produce and the real feed cannot: one pull is one window, and comparing it to a previous
 * window needs history this store does not keep by design. A delta is the single easiest number to
 * fake convincingly, so it is absent rather than approximated.
 *
 * A MISSING NUMBER SAYS SO. `undefined` reaches the tile and prints as "no data yet". It is never
 * rendered as 0, because **0 impressions is a claim** and a different one from "the platform did not
 * tell us". That distinction is the reason `summarise` keeps sums optional all the way through.
