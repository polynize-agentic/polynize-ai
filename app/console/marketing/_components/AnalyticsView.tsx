/**
 * THE INTERACTIVE ANALYTICS (D87). Range presets, a real chart over time, and the platform bars
 * split by who earned them.
 *
 * Three asks from Marrs, in his words:
 *   "I like the visual that you had on the test data, which showed a graph over time... Is it
 *    possible for us to do that for the 90 days?"
 *   "Is it possible for us to have a button that says the last week, the last month, and the last
 *    90 days, so you can choose between those?"
 *   "Is there a way of showing what is Shourov, what is Marrs... part of that colour could be mine,
 *    part of it could be Shourov's... you could see, even roughly, what percentage of that line was
 *    coming from who."
 *
 * WHY THIS IS A CLIENT COMPONENT WHEN THE PANEL DELIBERATELY WAS NOT. The original panel's comment
 * says it should not cost a client bundle at the bottom of two pages, and that was right when there
 * was nothing to interact with. There is now: a range switcher, a crosshair and a hover on every
 * segment. The alternative, a range in the url, would navigate the whole page to filter a panel at
 * the bottom of it.
 *
 * ONE PULL SERVES EVERY RANGE. The store holds ninety days, so switching range filters what is
 * already here: instant, free, and it cannot fail halfway.
 *
 * `today` COMES FROM THE SERVER, not from `new Date()`. A client component renders on the server
 * first, and a clock read during that render disagrees with the browser's, which is a hydration
 * mismatch rather than a cosmetic difference. Every range is derived from the prop.
