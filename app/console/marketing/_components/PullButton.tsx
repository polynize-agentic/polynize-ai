/**
 * PULL NOW (D86, made legible in D88).
 *
 * Marrs: "The pull now button is not working anymore. Just have a look into that."
 *
 * WHAT WAS WRONG IS THAT IT SAID NOTHING, and on the engine page it said nothing for a long time.
 * One press fired a single request that walked all five brands one after another, on somebody else's
 * analytics API, inside a 120 second budget. A press that takes most of a minute and then reports
 * neither a number nor an error is indistinguishable from a dead button, and there was no way to
 * tell "still going" from "finished with nothing" from "broken".
 *
 * WORSE: A PULL COULD SUCCEED AND STILL LEAVE THE PANEL EMPTY. The route returns `ok` when it has
 * recorded a per-stream failure, because one unmapped brand must not fail the other four. So five
 * refused brands returned 200 and the button showed nothing at all. That is the shape of bug that
 * makes a person distrust a tool rather than report it.
 *
 * SO IT IS NOW ONE REQUEST PER STREAM, driven from here:
 *   - the label names the stream it is on, so a slow brand looks slow rather than broken;
 *   - each request stands alone, so no single hang can eat the whole run's budget;
 *   - the outcome is printed and stays printed: how many posts, from how many streams, and every
 *     stream that failed, with its reason.
 *
 * A TIMEOUT PER REQUEST, because "not working" was a real report and a hung fetch has no natural
 * end. Ninety seconds is far beyond a healthy call and well inside the route's own budget.
