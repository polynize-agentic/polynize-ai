/**
 * WHAT APRIL HAS BEEN TOLD (D93).
 *
 * Marrs asked for a way to give her feedback from any chat window. This is the other half, and
 * without it the feature is a write-only pile: notes accumulate, nobody can see what is in force,
 * and the prompts quietly fill up with things he said once nine weeks ago.
 *
 * THREE THINGS IT HAS TO ANSWER, and it is built around them rather than around the data:
 *
 * 1. WHAT IS IN FORCE RIGHT NOW, and where. A rule he cannot see is a rule he cannot trust, and the
 *    scope was guessed from context when the note was taken, so it has to be visible and changeable.
 * 2. WHAT IS NOT BEING APPLIED. The per-scope cap REFUSES rather than rotates (see feedback.ts), so
 *    anything over it is named here. A limit that silently drops things is a limit nobody can plan
 *    around.
 * 3. WHAT IS ACTUALLY A DEFECT. Two of his first three pieces of feedback were bugs rather than
 *    preferences, and a note cannot fix a bug: it leaves April told two opposite things. Marking one
 *    a defect takes it out of every prompt and puts it on a list to be fixed in code.
 *
 * Team scope only.
