/**
 * POST /console/marketing/narrative/[id]/hero
 *
 * MAKE THE LOOK. One image for the whole narrative, generated first, that every later image is
 * generated against.
 *
 * Marrs: "we need a 'Hero Image' as an option, so a main hero image gets created that can then
 * set the style for the rest of the images."
 *
 * FOUR AT A TIME, AT 4:3 (D56). Marrs: "I would like the prompt to generate four images, and
 * then you choose the one you want. Make those 4:3 ratio."
 *
 * One prompt, one request, four candidates. Soul takes `batch_size`, so this is one generation
 * call rather than four, and 4:3 is a real Soul size (`2048x1536`) rather than a crop of a
 * landscape, which matters because a crop would mean the photograph he picked is not quite the
 * photograph he gets.
 *
 * WHY IT IS A DECISION AND NOT A SIDE EFFECT. The reference plumbing already existed: the slide
 * render route passes `referenceUrl` to Soul as `image_reference`, and the slide screen was
 * inferring that reference from whichever slide happened to be approved first. So the look of a
 * ten slide set was decided by approval order. The hero replaces that with one image he chose,
 * and settling it on ONE generation before spending ten is the whole economy of the thing.
 *
 * ALL FOUR ARE COPIED INTO OUR BUCKET BEFORE THEY ARE SHOWN, and that is not premature work.
 *
 * A Higgsfield url is temporary and `/media/add` stores a url and nothing else, so registering
 * one straight off their CDN makes a library entry that works today and 404s later. The
 * alternative shape, hosting only the one he picks, means the client hands the server a url to go
 * and fetch, which is a request forgery hole for the sake of saving three small files. So the
 * candidates he judges ARE the files that get used, and the three he rejects are unregistered
 * bytes in a bucket that nothing points at.
 *
 * Byte for byte, through mirrorImageToHost rather than the compositor. renderAndHostOverlay would
 * also produce a hosted copy, but it re-encodes to PNG at a frame you give it, which is right
 * when the point is to compose something and wrong when the point is to keep exactly what the
 * model made. The hero used to go through it to force the 1080 x 1350 post frame; at 4:3 there is
 * nothing to force.
 *
 * NOTHING IS PERSISTED HERE. Four hosted files and no record of them anywhere: the screen shows
 * them, and blessing one registers THAT one through the library's own add route and saves it onto
 * the narrative through ./state. Same discipline as the slide routes: a rejected hero leaves no
 * litter in the library and no half-state on the narrative.
 *
 * Team scope only.

   *
   * Marrs: "they're all in really weird aspect ratios for some reason. There's this white space,
   * which I don't like."
   *
   * The white was not a layout fault and not a wrong canvas size: every file came back at the
   * 4:3 that was asked for. The white was GENERATED. The old tail asked the model to "leave clear
   * negative space with low detail and low contrast where a caption could sit", and a prompt
   * saying "a hyper realistic, historically accurate black and white photo" plus "leave clear
   * negative space" is a fair description of an archival PRINT: a photograph mounted on white
   * card. So the model drew the mount. Four candidates, four different photo shapes, each floated
   * on white, which is why the aspect looked random when the canvas never changed.
   *
   * That instruction was inherited from the slide path, where type IS composited over the image
   * and quiet space is the whole point. A hero carries no type: D56 stopped cropping it to the
   * post frame, and its job is to be the scene and to be the style reference. So the rule is
   * inverted here rather than softened, and it names the failure explicitly, because "fill the
   * frame" alone does not rule out a picture of a picture.
   *
   * The no-words rule stays and stays last: a long prompt loses its opening instructions first,
   * and Soul cannot spell.
