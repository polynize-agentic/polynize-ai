/**
 * POST /console/marketing/narrative/[id]/build: Gate 3's confirm (D40).
 *
 * The ticks become MASTER pieces: one piece per master asset, not one per
 * scheduled post. The expansion into per-channel posts happens at Gate 5,
 * on the calendar, which already models one entry per channel post. This
 * split matches how the work is actually done: a script is written once and
 * placed nine times.
 *
 * Idempotent on masters: re-confirming with different ticks creates only the
 * masters that are missing and never duplicates or deletes one that exists,
 * because a master may already carry edits or media. An unticked master's
 * placements simply stop being planned at Gate 5.
