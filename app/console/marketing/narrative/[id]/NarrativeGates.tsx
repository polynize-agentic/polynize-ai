/**
 * GATES 2 TO 5 (D40). One gate on screen at a time, one mint decision bar, back goes
 * back. The server page loads the narrative and everything the current gate needs; this
 * component owns the interactions and the gate transitions.
 *
 * Design decisions carried from the approved mockup, verbatim:
 * - Gate 2 is the article full screen with April docked beside it. The old interview
 *   is dead: the article is drafted the moment the narrative arrives here, and every
 *   refinement is either a direct edit or one instruction to April.
 * - Gate 3 is the kit, per platform, defaults on. The count is pieces of content,
 *   never "placements": that word meant nothing to the operator.
 * - Gate 4 lists the master pieces and opens the existing editors. The one-card
 *   flow is the next build; tonight the gate is honest about being a checklist.
 * - Gate 5 queues the wave as DRAFTS on the calendar first (his call: draft-first),
 *   and the button flips the whole wave live through Metricool.
