/**
 * POST /console/marketing/narrative/[id]/wave: Gate 5 (D40).
 *
 * Two actions, matching the draft-first decision:
 *  - plan: expand the kit into per-channel calendar entries as DRAFTS, each at
 *    its channel's next open 2-a-day slot. Idempotent: existing entries for a
 *    (master, channel) pair are counted before any are created, so reloading
 *    the gate never doubles the wave.
 *  - ship: every draft entry of this narrative goes through publishEntry, the same
 *    path the calendar's own Schedule uses, flipping the wave live in Metricool.
 *
 * Slot assignment treats the WHOLE channel as one queue: entries from other
 * narratives occupy slots too, so two narratives shipped in the same week interleave
 * instead of colliding.
