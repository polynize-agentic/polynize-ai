/**
 * The Script screen (Phase-1 tickets T2 + T4). An agent-drafted, human-editable
 * script with an on-screen context chat, owner-scoped and autosaving, in the
 * authed console.
 *
 * Autosave is debounced (1s) + flushed on blur + flushed on unmount, and
 * SERIALIZED: at most one PUT is in flight and the latest content is coalesced,
 * so a slow/out-of-order request can never overwrite a newer edit.
 *
 * The chat (T4) rewrites the whole script on command. Two guards protect the
 * user's work: the editor is LOCKED while a chat command is in flight (so
 * concurrent typing can't be clobbered by the returning revision), and every
 * chat apply is one-click UNDOABLE (so an over-aggressive rewrite is always
 * recoverable, since the store keeps no version history).
