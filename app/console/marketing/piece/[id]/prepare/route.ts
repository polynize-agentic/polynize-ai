 *
 * For each channel the piece targets, April adapts the approved base copy to that
 * platform's register (in one call), and we create/refresh one calendar entry per
 * channel (status 'draft', unscheduled). The calendar then shows what's coming and
 * lets the owner set dates; actual scheduling to Metricool is a later step.
 *
 * Idempotent per (piece, channel): re-preparing refreshes the copy but preserves
 * any date/status already set. Team-scope only; owner + piece from the session/route.

- Instagram / TikTok: punchier, first line is a strong hook, a few relevant hashtags at the end are fine.
- X: tight, one sharp idea, under ~280 characters.
- Substack / Newsletter: a warmer, slightly longer lead-in is fine.
${voice}

Polynize voice:
- Direct, contrarian, concrete. No hype, no filler, no corporate throat-clearing.
- Never use em-dashes. Use commas, periods, or colons instead.
