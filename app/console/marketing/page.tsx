 * the unit of work is a narrative rather than a stream. That reasoning was right and incomplete:
 * a narrative belongs to exactly one person or brand, and with five of them a single flat board
 * mixes five people's work into one list where nobody can find their own. So the board did not
 * go away, it moved down a level. Whose work, then which narrative.
 *
 * The card counts are NARRATIVES now, not concepts and pieces. What matters on this screen is
 * how much work each person has moving and how much has landed.
