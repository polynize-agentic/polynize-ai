 * A STREAM'S BOARD (D45): this person's or brand's narratives at their gates, and below it the
 * setup that shapes them plus the older per-stream sections.
 *
 * Marrs: "when you click on anyone's individual stream, you have the narratives as the board...
 * that makes more sense." So the board leads. It used to be the marketing home and it mixed five
 * people's work into one list; here it is scoped to one of them, which is the level at which the
 * question "what am I working on" actually has an answer.
 *
 * D48 removed Core concepts, In development and Podcasts from this page on his word: "that's the
 * old way of thinking." The narrative's own article replaced the concept as the source of truth at
 * Gate 2 (D40), so none of the three is the way in any more. NOTHING WAS DELETED: the concept
 * pages, the development hub and the podcast screens all still exist and are reachable by url,
 * with their data untouched. This page simply stops leading with them, and stops paying for three
 * store reads on the way to first byte.
 *
 * Stream setup sits ABOVE the narratives, his layout call.
