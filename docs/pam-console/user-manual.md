# Polynize Marketing Console (PAM) — User Manual (Master)

**The complete reference for what the console does and how to use it.** This is the *master* version: it covers every function plus the model and gotchas behind it. A simplified team-facing version will be distilled from this later (strip the "how it works" notes, keep the "how to use it").

**Status key:** ✅ shipped · 🔜 next build · 🧪 shipped, pending human test (see `testing-checklist.md`)

---

## 1. What PAM is

PAM (Polynize Agent Management) is the marketing engine: it takes an idea, shapes it into a reusable **core concept**, turns that into finished **pieces** of content, and publishes them on a schedule. The console is the cockpit; specialist agents (April for copy/voice, and later Mikey/Raph/Donnie) plug in at their stages.

**The spine (memorise this):**

> **Concept → Piece → Publish**
> A core concept feeds many pieces. Each piece is produced for one or more platforms. Finished pieces are prepared into per-channel posts, scheduled on the calendar, and pushed to the socials via Metricool.

**Streams** are brand buckets — who the content is *for*. There are five: **Polynize, Marrs, Shourov, Kristin, Julian**. Almost everything (concepts, brand voice, content series, media, pieces) is scoped to a stream.

---

## 2. Access ✅

- The console lives at **pam.polynize.ai**. Sign in with an approved team email.
- Team members see everything across all streams. (Client accounts are redirected to their own blueprint and never see the marketing console.)
- Top-left **"PAM control centre"** link is always the way home.

## 3. The marketing home: whose content 🧪 (D45)

`/console/marketing` is **the picker**: one card per stream and creator, Polynize, Marrs, Shourov, Kristin and Julian, each showing how many narratives are in flight and how many have shipped. Click a name and you get **that person's board**: their narratives sitting at their gates, in gate order, with **New narrative** as the primary action. A Narrative is one idea exploited into a week of content, and it moves through five gates: **Idea → Article → Kit → Create → Ship**. One gate on screen at a time, one decision per screen, back goes back.

**A narrative belongs to exactly one stream.** That is what decides its channels, its voice, its CTA, and which post frames its kit offers: a **person** gets the Hard moment frame, the **Polynize** brand gets the Field report instead. Adding a teammate adds a board and changes nothing else.

- **Gate 1 · Idea**: type a fresh idea or pick from that stream's inbox. There is nothing else to decide: you got here from someone's board, so whose narrative it is was already answered by the click.
- **Gate 2 · Article**: April drafts the long form (300 to 450 words) in **plain text**, no asterisks and no headings, because nothing renders markdown and the article publishes as written (D57); edit it directly or give her one instruction at a time in the docked chat. The article is the source of truth for every piece cut from it, and it publishes as-is. The interview step is retired.
- **Gate 3 · Kit**: per-platform ticks, and each one now names the actual post rather than a count (D42). LinkedIn gives you the **Article**, a **Contrarian post**, a **Hard moment** (or a **Field report** on the Polynize lane), **Numbered rules**, and the **Document carousel** (off, no PDF builder yet). Instagram gives **Reels x3**, the **Carousel** and one **Image**. TikTok and YouTube carry the same three cuts. Defaults total **15 posts**, and the button says so. Confirming creates one piece per thing that has to be written, so three named LinkedIn posts are three pieces with three drafts, not one draft shown three times.
- **Gate 4 · Create**: starts with **The look** (see §3b3), then one card per thing to make, video first because it is the long pole. Each card says whether it is finished: `✓ ready`, or what is missing (`no images yet, needs 10`). Text and video open their editors as before; **image cards open the slide run** (see §8c). Seven cards on the default kit. April is told what each one has to BE: the contrarian post gets "state the belief, then break it" and a 1,300 to 2,500 character band; the numbered rules post gets a different instruction; the video script is told there is no target duration and where on-screen text is allowed to sit.
- **The lanes on a stream board** carry a second line under the bar once a narrative has pieces (D58): a hollow dot for each piece still being made, under Create, and a solid mint dot for each one that is ready, under Ship. The bar says where the narrative is; the dots say where its pieces are, which after Gate 3 is not the same question. Shipped narratives drop the dots, since everything is behind them.
- **Gate 5 · Ship**: the week laid out from each channel's slots, two a day, queued as **drafts** first. One button ships the wave: scheduled posts go live through Metricool, hand-posts are emailed to you (see §3c). Every chip on the grid carries its time, so you can see what lands when (see §3d).

### 3b3. The look: one image the whole narrative follows 🧪 (D51, rebuilt D56)

Gate 4 opens with it, because it is upstream of every picture below it. Write a line about what this narrative looks like (a scene, the light, the mood) and press **Make 4 to choose from**.

- **Four at a time, at 4:3.** One prompt, one wait, four candidates, two across.
- **Click one and it opens full size.** That is where you choose. Nothing about clicking a picture is irreversible: the tile enlarges, the viewer commits. Escape or the backdrop closes it.
- Each tile also has its own **Use this one**, so an obvious winner does not need the round trip.
- **Try 4 more** as many times as you like. Only the one you bless is saved, and it goes into the stream library stamped with this narrative so its own posts see it first.
- The one that is set stays on screen at a readable size and opens in the same viewer, so you can check it without digging.

Once it is set, **every image generated anywhere in this narrative is generated against it**: each carousel slide, each post image. That is what makes a set look like a set instead of like six stock photos.

Optional, and it stays optional. A narrative with no look behaves exactly as it did: each image finds its own way, and a carousel infers its reference from the first slide you approve.

*Worth knowing:* it is four generations per attempt rather than one. That is deliberate and it only happens here, because this is the single image everything else follows, so the minutes spent settling it are paid back across the whole narrative. It is also usually a scene rather than a person: no Soul ID and no reference photo are sent, so "1882 New York, a crowd on a winter street" is exactly the kind of prompt it is for.

### 3b2. What the kit knows about each post 🧪 (D42)

Every tick carries the finished post's real spec, and the spec reaches April rather than sitting in a document. What that buys you:

- **Length** comes from the data, not a guess. A LinkedIn post targets 1,300 to 2,500 characters and never under 400. (That band is the overlap of two large studies that disagree with each other, so it is a hint. The 400 floor is the one thing every study agrees on.)
- **The link never goes in the body** on LinkedIn. One body link costs about 18.8% of median reach, and you cannot have a link preview and an image in the same post. It goes in the first comment.
- **Every post ships with an image.** 1080 x 1350 does double duty: it is LinkedIn's tallest legal ratio and Instagram's recommended format at once.
- **Hashtags are off** on Instagram, against common practice, on a 24 million post study measuring 31.70% fewer views on posts that carry them.
- **Captions are counted in the platform's own unit.** LinkedIn 3,000 characters, Instagram and TikTok 2,200, and YouTube's description is 5,000 **bytes**, where an emoji costs three or four.
- **What we do not know is passed on as an instruction.** April is told not to claim a target video duration (no platform publishes one), not to treat the character band as best practice, and not to repeat the "single images get 30% less reach" line, which has no dataset behind it.

*Where the numbers live:* `docs/pam-console/output-spec.md` is the research, `lib/marketing/kit.ts` is the version the code reads, and `lib/marketing/safe-area.ts` holds the vertical safe area. Change one, change the others.

### 3d. The slots have a type 🧪 (D46)

On **LinkedIn**, the two daily slots are not interchangeable:

- **Morning (08:30) is the video slot.**
- **Afternoon (12:30) is text and images.**

Instagram, TikTok and YouTube take whatever comes, because nothing has been decided about them.

**It is a preference, not a rule, and that is deliberate.** If there is no video waiting, the morning slot takes a text post rather than sitting empty. The alternative was a hard filter, which would have honoured the shape exactly and gone quiet: on a quiet week that is one post a day on LinkedIn instead of two, which is the opposite of what you asked for.

**When that happens the grid says so.** A post sitting in the wrong kind of slot is marked with a `*` in coral, and a line under the week explains it. If you see `08:30 Rules*` on LinkedIn, it means the video slot was free and there was no video for it.

**LinkedIn now gets a video post.** It did not before: every LinkedIn item in the kit was text or an image, so the video slot could never have been filled. One cut goes to LinkedIn, the same file as the reels and the TikToks with a LinkedIn caption. Worth knowing: the only LinkedIn video number in the research is a 36% year on year fall in reach. This is a bet on surface area, not something the data asked for, and your own numbers will settle it.

**Weekends stay on.** No source anywhere publishes a best-day figure, and cutting to weekdays would drop LinkedIn from 14 slots a week to 10. If you want weekends off, it is a setting, not a rebuild.

### 3c. Two ways a post can ship 🧪 (D41)

Not everything goes through Metricool. Each channel in a lane has a **publish mode**:

- **Scheduled (auto)** the console pushes it to Metricool at its slot. This is everything by default.
- **Hand-post (manual)** the console prepares the post and **emails it to you to publish yourself**. The default for **Marrs + LinkedIn only**, because posting natively from the phone reaches further than posting through a scheduler.

At Gate 5 the hand-posts are marked ✋ in the week grid and the button says exactly what it will do, for example **"Ship · schedule 16, send me 3"**. If a whole wave is hand-posted, Metricool does not need to be connected at all.

**The email** arrives once per wave, not once per post, and is built to be used on a phone: the post copy sits in one grey block so a long-press selects the whole thing, the **first comment** (where the link goes) is separate, and media are plain links you can open and save to the camera roll. Nothing in that email is scheduled. Nothing goes out until you post it.

*How it works:* the mode is stamped onto each calendar entry when the wave is **planned**, so changing a lane's setting later never rewrites how an already-planned wave goes out. Entries planned before this existed are treated as scheduled, which is how they were already behaving.

A stream's page is two things now (D48): **Stream setup** at the top (brand voice, content templates, media library), and under it **the narratives as lanes**.

Each narrative is one row on a shared gate scale. A gate it has already passed is a small filled square; the gate it is **at** holds the title. So how far right a headline sits is how far along it is, and the whole column reads as a funnel:

```
[■][■][■][■][■] The 40 hour week is a rounding error      SHIPPED
[■][■][■][■] Strip the AI out first                  GATE 5 · SHIP
[■][■] Emergent AI                                    GATE 3 · KIT
Nobody wants another dashboard                       GATE 1 · IDEA
```

**Most developed at the top.** A fresh idea has nothing behind it, so it starts hard left at the bottom and climbs as it moves. That is also where ideas live now: a gate 1 narrative **is** an idea, still visible, with no separate list to keep.

Core concepts, in-development pieces and podcasts are no longer on this page. Those screens still exist and nothing was deleted, they are just not the way in any more.

`/console/marketing/streams` redirects to the front page, because the front page is that screen again.

---

## 4. A stream's home ✅

Opening a stream shows three zones:

**Stream setup** (top — the assets that shape everything downstream):
- **Brand voice** — the register every piece in this stream is written in.
- **Content series** — the repeatable post formats this stream makes.
- **Media library** — the reusable photos and video this stream's posts are built from. 🧪 *(new)*

**Core concepts** — the stream's concept docs, with three actions: **Develop a concept**, **Import a concept**, **Concept library**.

**In development** — one card per concept that has pieces in progress; click in to that concept's development hub.

---

## 5. Brand voice ✅

Each stream has one brand-voice document (`Stream setup → Brand voice`). Paste or edit it; April reads it whenever she interviews, synthesises a concept, or drafts a post, so everything in that stream sounds like the brand. Autosaves.

*How it works:* per-stream (not per-person), so a stream sounds consistent no matter who produces for it.

---

## 6. Concepts

A **core concept** is a living master document — a strategic idea, framed for an audience, that many pieces draw from.

- **Develop a concept** ✅ — opens an interview with **April**. Give her your idea; she draws it out and writes the concept doc. Opener: *"Give me your idea for a core concept and we can shape it into something great together."* Includes a working-framing field and a Start-over button; the interview survives a reload.
- **Import a concept** ✅ — paste a finished `.md` (e.g. one you extracted from a meeting in a separate, secure session) and it becomes a concept in the stream. A same-title import asks before overwriting.
- **Update concept** ✅ — on a concept page, tell April *what's changed* and she restructures the whole doc in place (same concept, no version history kept).
- **Concept library** ✅ — browse the concepts in *other* streams and **copy** one into yours. It's a copy, never a move — the original stays put.

*Note on meeting extraction:* pulling concepts straight from Fireflies transcripts is **postponed** for client-data security. For now, extract manually in an isolated session and use **Import**. The method is captured in `concept-extraction.md`.

---

## 7. Content Series (templates) ✅

A **content series** is a repeatable recipe: it carries the plan (format + platforms + ICP) and the production instructions, so "concept + series" is enough to make a piece. Manage them at `Stream setup → Content series`.

Each series declares: **what you bring** (inputs), **what you get** (outputs), **how it's made** (the production recipe April follows), plus an example and a lifecycle status (**active / developing / retired** — kept or killed on real performance).

There's a **built-in starter library** you can copy series from, and a series doesn't go *active* until one real piece made from it was good.

---

## 8. Producing content

From a concept's development hub, click **Create content**.

- The default path is **pick a content series** (its template carries the plan). The fallback is a **custom plan** (choose platforms, format, ICP yourself).
- This creates one **piece** per selected format. Video pieces open the **Script screen**; text/image pieces open the **Text screen**.

### 8a. Text screen (posts) ✅
- **Draft from the concept** — April writes the post copy (in the stream's brand voice). Edit freely; everything autosaves.
- **Copy post** — copy the text out.
- **Mark approved** — locks it as ready; then **Prepare posts for N channels** builds the per-channel calendar entries.
- **Media** — attach images/video from this stream's library (see §9). 🧪

### 8b. Script screen (video) ✅
- An editable **script** with an on-screen **chat** that rewrites it by command (every chat edit is one-click undoable; the editor locks while the chat is working).
- **Teleprompter** — a recording view at its own URL. Continuous scroll of the whole script;
  space starts and stops it, up/down set the speed, `+`/`-` the size, `Home` returns to the top.
  **`f` (or the `flip` button) flips top to bottom for the beam-splitter glass.** That is the
  one axis this rig needs: the original single control had been applying the horizontal flip
  instead, which is why it never worked. Horizontal is deliberately gone rather than hidden, on
  the same principle as the rest of the strip: on set a button that does nothing useful is worse
  than a missing one. Flip persists **per device**, not per piece, because it belongs to the rig:
  the iPad in the hood stays set and the laptop stays plain. When flipped, the first line sits at
  the bottom of the physical screen and at the top through the glass, which is correct, and
  scrolling always advances the script.
- **Media** — attach the recorded video / b-roll from this stream's library. 🧪
- *Note:* the automated **video cut / treatment middle** (Descript-orchestrated Podcast Clips, etc.) is 🔜 **the next build**. Today the script screen + teleprompter are the video tools; the finished video is added to the piece via the media library.

---

### 8b2. The platform preview 🧪 (D59)

The text editor is three columns now: **the chat on the far left, what you are editing in the middle, what it will look like on the right.**

The preview is not decoration. It shows **where the post folds**, which is the only thing on that screen you cannot see by reading your own draft:

- **LinkedIn** folds at about 140 characters **or three lines, whichever comes first.** That second one catches out anything written in the house style: five short lines can be 120 characters and still be cut after the third. The panel tells you which limit bit.
- **Instagram** truncates at about 125 characters, and shows the picture before the caption, which is how that feed actually reads.
- **TikTok** gets no fold line, because nobody publishes the figure and a made-up one is worse than none.

The card is light because both feeds are light. Everything past the fold is faded rather than hidden, so you can still see how much there is. If a piece serves more than one platform, the icons top right switch between them.

*Worth knowing:* this is ours, not Metricool's. Their preview is a feature of their web app; their API has 527 endpoints and none of them renders a post. Ours works before anything is connected, and it renders the same fields the publisher sends.

At narrower windows the three columns become two (editor and preview) with the chat underneath, and on a phone it stacks: write, check it, then talk about it.

### 8c. The slide run (image cards) 🧪 (D47)

The carousel and the quote card open here. Same screen, and it already knows how many slides it needs: ten for a carousel, one for a card.

1. **Pick the look.** Three of them, each drawn on the screen so you can see what you are choosing (D55).
   - **Statement plate**: no photo at all. One claim set big on the brand field, with a supporting line. Nothing is generated, so a whole set is instant and free.
   - **Split card**: a photo in a window up top, the words underneath. Half the slides carry one. This is the default.
   - **Full frame**: one generated image edge to edge with the words over it. Ten slides is ten generations.
   Each option says what it costs before you pick it. There is also an optional **standing label** for the bottom left of every slide, like `EMERGENT AI`.
2. **Write the slides from the article.** One tap. April writes the whole set: a shared *look* for the deck, the caption, and per slide the words that go on it plus, on the looks that take one, a description of the picture behind it. What she is asked for depends on the look: a statement plate gets no picture briefs at all.
3. **Read down the slides and fix the words.** This is the part that matters and it costs nothing. The words are the carousel.
4. **Make slide 1.** Look at it. If the look is wrong, edit the look line and remake it. Settle the world on one picture before spending ten.
5. **Make the rest.** It works down the list and stops at each one for you. Walk away, come back to a set to review.
6. **Approve each slide.** Approving is also advancing. A slide only counts once it has a real picture saved to the library.
7. **Wrong picture?** Remake that one. **Wrong words?** Fix them and re-render, which is instant and free because it reuses the picture already made.

**Changing the look after it is written.** Open `THE LOOK` on the run screen. Most switches are free: the words and the pictures the set already has are redrawn in the new look, nothing is generated, and one button does all of them. The exception is going from a statement plate to one of the photo looks, because a plate has no picture briefs in it for anything to draw. That one says *April writes the set again* on the option before you click it, and asks before it throws the words away.

**Type sizes itself.** There is no size control any more. The fitter sizes the type to the words it was given, which is what stops a fourteen word headline running off the slide. Where the words sit on the picture is a full frame question only: the other two looks are the typesetting.

**The words go on in code, not by the model.** Brand type, brand colours, wrap a phrase in `*asterisks*` to put it in mint. The picture behind is generated; the type is composited. That is what makes ten slides look like one set, and it is why the picture prompt never asks for text.

**Every slide comes out at exactly 1080 x 1350.** Instagram crops every slide of a carousel to the first slide's size, so they have to be identical by construction.

**Post order is slide order.** Nothing to keep in sync: the ids on the post are rebuilt from the slide numbers every time it saves.

*Worth knowing:* the only image model connected today is photoreal, so every background is a photograph. No diagrams or charts yet. A full frame carousel is ten generations, so it is a coffee break rather than an interaction, which is exactly why the split card is the default and the statement plate exists.

## 9. Media library 🧪 (new — D27)

Reusable photos and video per stream, at `Stream setup → Media library`.

**The model:** a media asset is a **link**, not an upload. The file lives in **Box.com** (or any host that gives a public direct link); the console stores only the link + a label. Box hosts and serves the file; Metricool fetches it by that link when the post goes out. So there's no upload limit in the console and nothing to store here — Box does the heavy lifting.

**Adding media:**
1. In **Box**, upload your file (per-file limit on this account is **5GB** — plenty for podcast video).
2. Open the file's **Share → Link Settings → copy the Direct Link** (the `/shared/static/…` one that ends in the file type — *not* the default `box.com/s/…` preview link).
3. In the console's Media library, **paste the link**, leave type on **Auto** (it detects image vs video), add an optional label, **Add**.

**Using media:** on any piece, the **media picker** shows that stream's library; click to attach. Attached media rides through **Prepare → calendar → Metricool** onto the real post. **One post = one video on its own, OR multiple images** — the picker enforces this because the platforms reject mixing media types or more than one video in a single post.

**Wrong library?** Tick the assets you want (the checkbox sits on each thumbnail, and there's a **Select all**), choose the stream from **Move to…**, and hit **Move**. Because an asset is only a link, nothing is re-uploaded and the Box file never moves. Soul IDs are unaffected: they live on the Higgsfield account and were trained on the link, which does not change. The one thing to know is that if the asset was already **attached** to a piece or calendar entry in the library you're moving it *out of*, that attachment quietly drops, since attachments resolve per stream. Move first, attach after.

**Delete** removes the reference from the library only; the Box file is untouched.

**Fast-follows (🔜, not built yet):** uploading straight from the console into Box, and auto-syncing a Box folder so files appear in the library automatically.

---

## 10. Calendar & scheduling ✅

The publishing calendar (top-level **Calendar** button, or after **Prepare posts**).

- **Prepare posts** (from an approved piece) creates one **calendar entry per channel**, with April adapting the copy to each platform's register, and copies any attached media onto each entry.
- **Views:** List, Month, Day.
- **Set a time** on an entry, then **Schedule** — it posts to Metricool at that local time.
- **Add to queue** — drops it into the next open **ideal-time slot** for that stream (per the posting schedule), instead of a time you pick.
- Each entry links out to Metricool and back to its piece.

*Timezone gotcha:* Metricool defaults brands to Madrid; the console sends each stream's own timezone (default Sydney) and the brand's Metricool timezone should match, so a 9am post doesn't land at 1am.

---

## 11. Metricool connection ✅

Publishing runs through **Metricool** (via its REST API, server-side — the console holds the credentials).

- **Connect Metricool** lists your Metricool brands and maps each **stream → Metricool brand**.
- Set each stream's **posting timezone + ideal-time slots** (these drive Add-to-queue).
- Credentials live in Vercel (added by Marrs, never pasted in chat).
- substack / newsletter aren't Metricool networks and are skipped automatically.

*Publishing model:* the console is the **hands** (makes the call, holds the creds); a future **Raph** agent could be the **brains** (proposing/rearranging the schedule) but is deferred — the console-side queue covers his near-term value.

---

## 12. Per-stream tracking ✅ / 🔜

Analytics land per stream (the loop-closing intelligence layer, "Donnie", is a **later build**). Today the per-stream structure is in place; the populated analytics dashboard is 🔜.

---

## Appendix

### The streams
Polynize (the company) · Marrs · Marrs Attacks · Shourov · Kristin · Julian.

**Marrs Attacks is private (D114).** It is Marrs's own account (Instagram, TikTok, YouTube; the split-screen explainer and the yap; no Polynize use case) and only he sees the card, the board and its numbers. Everyone else's console has five cards. The Marrs card is Marrs the co-founder: his LinkedIn, Polynize content, the ordinary kit. The Studio button is also his alone, and on every board other than Polynize, Marrs and Marrs Attacks the video rows of the kit are greyed with the reason on them: video is shot in his room.

Patricia, Dhamiri and Avik were removed on 2026-07-28 when they left the team. Removing a stream only hides it: anything those streams owned still exists in storage and is untouched, it simply no longer appears on the dashboard and its stream pages report "unknown stream". Restoring one is a single line in `lib/marketing/streams.ts`. (The old "Team" stream was removed earlier.)

### ICP archetypes (used in the Output-plan / content-series ICP field)
Organisational Architect · High-Stakes Operator · Revenue Accelerator · Talent Champion · Service Ops Leader. *(Not final; firm up as the ICP messaging doc solidifies.)*

### Where things are stored (plain version)
- **Concepts, brand voice, content series** live in Polynize's private storage, keyed per stream.
- **Media files** live in **Box** (the console stores only the links).
- **Pieces, calendar entries** are the working records the console reads and writes.
- Nothing sensitive is ever pasted into chat; credentials go into Vercel directly.

### Non-negotiables that shape the copy
- Brand tokens are load-bearing (coral = human, amber = hybrid, mint = agent).
- User-facing copy is final and contains **no em-dashes**.
- State survives a reload at every step.

### Deeper references
- `decisions.md` — the load-bearing decision log (D1 to D41).
- `production-model.md` — the concept→piece→publish model in detail.
- `testing-checklist.md` — what to verify in the running console.
- `output-spec.md` — what a finished post must look like per platform (sizes, safe areas, post types).
- `concept-extraction.md`, `brand-voice-builder-prompt.md`, `april-skills/` — the intelligence behind April.

*Master reference. Keep it in sync as functions land; distil the team version from it when the feature set settles.*
