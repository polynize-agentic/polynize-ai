# PAM Console: the to-do list

**The running list of what is asked for and not yet built.** Kept here rather than in chat because a request made in one session and acted on three sessions later needs somewhere durable to live. Newest asks at the top of each section.

Anything already built is in `decisions.md`, not here. This file is only what is still owed.

## The order, set by Marrs 25 August 2026

**Build order:** hero image (**done**, D51) → narrative image pool (**done**, D52) → template picker (**done**, D55). All three landed. Next up is the priority 1 gap: the hero offered as the image on a text post, and item 1, no file upload.

**Flow priority, which is a different axis and outranks the build order when they disagree:**

| Priority | Flow |
|---|---|
| **1** | **Text + image.** The one to get right. |
| 2 | Video |
| 3 | PDF |
| low | LinkedIn carousel |

That reordering matters more than it looks. It means the carousel work in progress is serving priority 3 and low, while **the image on a text post is priority 1** and today has no generation path at all: `TextOutputScreen` offers only the media picker. So the hero and the narrative pool are not carousel features, they are the text-plus-image flow, and the template picker is the one item that is genuinely carousel-first.

## Blocking a full walkthrough

**1b. Generated images in the media library were saved as vendor urls, so they would have 404'd. FIXED (D60).**

`/media/add` stores a url and nothing else, by design (D2, amended 2026-07-14): a media asset is a reference to a file hosted somewhere else. That is right for a Box link and wrong for a Higgsfield generation, whose url is temporary.

**The fix went in `/media/generate`, not in `/add`.** Auditing the four routes that hand a url to the library showed exactly one hole: `/edit` already returned `hostGeneratedImage`'s url and `/overlay` already returned `renderAndHostOverlay`'s, both ours, and `/generate` was the only one still handing back a raw vendor url. So `/add` keeps its contract untouched and needs no flag from a client that might forget to send one, and all three generation routes now agree.

**Anything registered before D60 is still a temporary url.** Nothing scans for or repairs them: a library entry that has stopped loading has to be regenerated. Worth knowing before someone hunts for a bug in the picker.

**1. No file upload. HALF FIXED (D65): images upload, video needs a decision from you.**

Images now upload straight from the library, presigned direct to the bucket so the 4.5MB Vercel body cap is not in the way. **Video is refused at the picker with the reason**, because building this surfaced the real blocker: the gap was never the upload, it was the DELIVERY. `/console/generated/...` reads a whole object into memory to serve it, and the bucket is private, so there is no way to hand Metricool a video url. That is why Box is the video path.

**Your call, three options:** (1) Vercel Blob, public urls by default, built for this, new integration on your account. (2) A public `pam/public/` prefix on the existing bucket via a policy change, cheapest. (3) Stream through the route with Range support, no infra change but fragile at Vercel's limits. I would pick them in that order.

~~**1. No file upload.**~~ A media asset is a URL reference only, so a recorded video has to go to Box by hand, its Direct Link copied, and pasted into the stream media library on a different screen before it can be attached to a piece. Nothing on the Script screen, the studio row, or the Recorded button says any of this. This is the last hard gap between Gate 4 and a published post.

**2. Metricool has been fired for real. DONE (D77, 27 August 2026).** Marrs scheduled a LinkedIn post through the console; it appeared in Metricool with its image and the right time. The payload, the media url being fetchable from their side, and the timezone are all proven. Everything downstream of Gate 5 has stopped being theory.

**2a. The dry run that got us there (D67).** `Send as draft` on any calendar entry sends the real call with `autoPublish` off: it proves the token, the brand id, the payload, the media urls and the timezone, and publishes nowhere. It also returns an `external_ref` to compare against the analytics `postId`, which is item 8's whole question, at no risk. The live press is still his and still unproven.

~~**2. Metricool has never actually been fired.**~~ The D18 gate: the publish button has never been pressed against a real brand. Everything downstream of Gate 5 is unproven.

---

## Carousels (in progress, 25 August 2026)

**3. Three stylistic templates. DONE (D55).**

What exists and is proven (`npm run proof:slides` writes one PNG per template at 1080 x 1350):

| Template | What it is | Generations for a 10 slide set |
|---|---|---|
| **Statement plate** | No photo. One claim set big on the brand field, ghosted slide number, accent rule, footer. | **0** |
| **Split card** | A photo in a window up top with the accent seam under it, words beneath. Half the slides carry one. | **5** |
| **Full frame** | One generated image edge to edge, words over it. The old behaviour. | **10** |

`generationsFor()` exists so the picker can tell him the cost before he picks, which is the answer to "a full carousel is a coffee break".

**The picker landed (D55).** Three options on the start panel, each drawing a 4:5 schematic of its own layout so the choice is visual, each saying what it costs. Split card is the default for a new set. Changing the look after the fact sits folded on the run screen: free in every direction except out of a statement plate, which has no picture briefs for a photo look to draw and so says *April writes the set again* before it asks.

**What the picker also fixed, and it was bigger than the missing field.** The render call was sending the slide's own fields and none of the plan's: no `template`, no `accent`, no `kicker`, no `total`. `total` defaulted to 1, so every slide ever rendered came out with no `03 / 10` index and no standing label. The footer the compositor draws had never appeared in production.

Two controls went with it, both of which had stopped meaning anything: the **Size** select (the fitter sizes type to the words it was given and cannot honour a fixed size and still fit) and **where the words sit** on any look but the full frame (the other two ARE the typesetting, and the compositor ignores `position` on both).

Original ask, kept for the reasoning. Marrs: *"we have to have three templates to choose from. Each needs to be on-brand graphically, with minimal text and a small image. One of them can be sort of full-image generation, maybe... Someone can select the template, write a bit about what they want, and then it generates the images."*

Constraint that decides the shape: **the only live image model is Soul, photoreal people.** It cannot make a diagram, a chart, an abstract mark or legible type. So at most one template can lean on generation; the other two must render from brand type and colour with at most one small photo. `next/og` is already a proven dependency (`lib/marketing/text-overlay.tsx`), so deterministic composition is the path.

The template is a property of the PLAN, not of each slide: picked once for the set.

Secondary benefit worth keeping in view: templates that need no image prompt per slide **shrink what April has to write**, which is the payload that has been making the 10-slide call fragile.

**3b. A HERO IMAGE that sets the style for the rest. DONE (D51), rebuilt as a four-up chooser (D56).** Marrs: *"we need a 'Hero Image' as an option, so a main hero image gets created that can then set the style for the rest of the images."*

"The look" panel now sits at the top of Gate 4, above the cards, because it is upstream of every image below it. Write a line, make it, and blessing it registers it in the library and pins it on the narrative. Every image generated afterwards is generated against it. Optional: a narrative with no hero behaves exactly as before.

**D56 rebuilt the panel** on his three complaints: one candidate became **four at 4:3**, the 64 by 80 thumbnail became a two-across grid at ~290px, and clicking a picture opens it full size, which is where the choice is made. 4:3 turned out to be a real Soul size (`2048x1536`) sitting unused in the SDK's 13 entry enum, so it needs no crop. The hero is therefore **landscape now and no longer pre-cropped to the 1080 x 1350 post frame**, which suits the LinkedIn text-plus-image flow and costs the ready made Instagram crop that nothing was using yet.

Still owed on the hero, small: it is not yet offered as the image on a **text** post, which is priority 1. It has a real library id so it is already attachable by hand; what is missing is the text screen offering it by default, which is the same build as 3c.

Original reasoning, kept:

**Half the plumbing existed.** The render route already takes a `referenceUrl` and passes it to Soul as `image_reference`, and `ImageScreen` already sends the first approved slide's background as that reference, so later slides are generated against the first one. What is missing is making it a deliberate STEP rather than a side effect of whichever slide happened to be approved first:

- Generate the hero on its own, before the set, and bless it explicitly.
- Pin it as the reference for every subsequent generation rather than inferring it from approval order.
- Let it also be slide 1's background, since that is usually what it is.

This belongs with the template picker (item 3), because "pick a template, then make the hero, then make the rest" is one flow and the hero is what makes a template's look concrete before ten generations are spent.

**3c. The image picker on a text post shows THIS narrative's images first. DONE (D52).**

Old ask below. Also worth recording, from the same conversation:

**THE HERO IS USUALLY A SCENE, NOT A FACE.** Marrs: *"the hero image is not always going to be someone's face. It could just be a Higgsfield-generated image. For the AI emergent article... they want to generate a hero image, which may be 1882, New York... For a particular narrative, it's less likely people are going to use the Soul image reference."*

The hero route already works this way: it sends a prompt only, with **no Soul ID and no reference image**, so it is scene generation from the first line. The panel copy asks for "a scene, the light, the mood" rather than a person. Nothing to change, and it is worth knowing that it was right by accident rather than by design, so nobody "fixes" it into a portrait tool later.

What this DOES sharpen is item 5. Soul is a photoreal-**people** model being asked for 1882 New York, which it will do passably and not well. A second model (Nano Banana Pro or GPT Image 2) matters more for the hero than for anything else in the kit, because the hero is the one image the whole narrative inherits from.

Original ask, kept for the reasoning: Marrs: *"on the text options within a narrative stream, the image selection should be a contextual, narrative specific image pool. As the images would be created for this narrative, then we can have a hidden section at the bottom which with a click you can open the media library."*

Right and it will get worse fast: `MediaPicker` lists the whole stream library, and every approved slide registers into it, so ten slides per carousel per narrative floods it within a week. The narrative's own images are the ones you want on its text posts.

`MediaAsset` has no narrative field today (`media_id`, `stream`, `owner`, `url`, `kind`, `label`, `source`, timestamps), and the only link is that slide approval labels an asset `"<piece title> slide N"`, which is a string match and not a link. So the build is: add an optional `narrative_ref` to `MediaAsset`, stamp it when a generated image is registered, and have `MediaPicker` show that narrative's pool by default with the full library folded behind one click at the bottom. Existing assets have no ref and belong in the library section, which is the correct place for them.

**3d. Gate 3 shows only connected platforms. DONE (D78).** Read from `/admin/simpleProfiles`, which the Connect page already calls: non-null per-platform field means connected. Fails open on every unknown. Kristin and Julian are unmapped and unconnected, so their gates show everything, which is correct: we cannot know yet.

**4. Refine what a carousel IS, across both platforms.** Marrs: *"whatever we have to do here has to be translated across LinkedIn and Instagram... those images would go into the LinkedIn carousel post and the Instagram carousel post."*

Current honest state, now visible on the Gate 4 card: the carousel says **Instagram, and only Instagram**, because the LinkedIn document post is blocked on two things (no PDF builder in the console, and Metricool document scheduling unverified). The slides are the shared asset; the container differs per platform. Once slides exist, turning them into a PDF is the next question.

**5. A second image model. DONE (D62).** Nano Banana 2 (`google/gemini-3.1-flash-image`) and Nano Banana Pro (`google/gemini-3-pro-image`) are both registered and both reachable from the hero panel's model picker and the media library. Both ids verified against OpenRouter's public model list. **Not yet fired against a live key**, so the first real generation is the test: a 404 comes back as "OpenRouter does not have this model enabled on this account" rather than as a silent failure.

The note below was written before it was built, and its guess about scope was wrong in a useful way: `higgsfield-models.ts` was NOT the only file that needed to change, because these models are on a different provider with no size parameter at all. See D62.

~~**5. A second image model.**~~ Nano Banana Pro (`google/gemini-3-pro-image`, about $2/1M) and ChatGPT Image 2 (`openai/gpt-5.4-image-2`, about $15/1M) are both strong on infographics and diagrams, against the console's photoreal-only Soul. `lib/marketing/higgsfield-models.ts` is the only file that needs to change. FLUX Kontext is commented out there because its endpoint 404s.

## Analytics (asked 25 August 2026)

**19. THE NEXT PHASE, in order (D94, revised D95; full brief in `analytics-and-scale.md`). Steps 1 and 4 DONE (D96); steps 2 and 6 DONE (D97), pending Marrs pasting migration 0014; step 3, the url join and the nightly pull DONE (D98), awaiting the first live pull; step 5 the leaderboard DONE (D99); step 7 evergreen DONE (D100), awaiting the first real press. **All seven steps built.** Migration 0014 pasted by Marrs on 8 September. What remains is proof on the live console: the first Pull now with the Vercel keys, the first Make evergreen.

**20. THE SPLIT-SCREEN EXPLAINER (D101, D102), 8 September.** Three Polynize use cases, none for Marrs Attacks; saves, shares, follows from the per-network feeds; the split-screen formula locked in the format with a title gate, a screen plan, named checks, a yap and version testing. Open: (a) the first real split-screen through the console proves the prompts; (b) `focus_anchor` is shown on the title option but not yet stored on the piece; (c) the prezie one-shot's system prompt still says "skip the hooks" and builds per beat, while the split-screen grammar sent as direction asks for six states of one object including tap 0; if the first board comes back as five pictures rather than six states, the system prompt needs a format branch; (d) the research arm (the phrase bank of first-person stems) is not built; April is told the rule and has no corpus.** The team's word is **use case**, not lane. (1) One function builds every outbound link with `utm_source`, `utm_medium` (social / dm / reply), `utm_campaign = use_case`, `utm_content = entry_id`; `first_comment` populated by prepare and the wave from the kit's placement rule; the link shown on the entry and in the hand-post brief so ManyChat flows and manual replies carry it too; Metricool shortener off. (2) First-party UTM and referrer capture on polynize.ai, stamped on the session insert, written to the lead (coordinate with the site session, which owns that code). (3) The url join: second read after publication stores `providers[].publicUrl` on the entry. (4) Use case on the Story, the six specs from the strategy's section 09 stored as data, carried down, in the link. (5) The frame ladder by use case, by magnet completions per post, `n` shown, rows under 3 faded. (5b) CRM: the lead carries use case, partner and stage reached (magnet, booked, trial, proposal, paid). In scope. (6) Evergreen autolists via `/lists/*`, item id on the entry. (7) Nightly pull. Answered: Vercel is Pro with Web Analytics Plus on; audience Australia then US; TikTok business account pending; shortener off; Google booking page not Calendly.

**6. Rename the front page.** Done: "Whose content" is now "Content engine".

**7y. Ranges, a real chart and a colour per person (D87).** Last 7 / 30 / 90 day buttons filtering one stored pull; a full-width line chart bucketed by day up to a month and by week beyond; platform bars stacked by stream with a validated five-slot series palette (analytics only, so the brand's coral/amber/mint keep meaning human/hybrid/agent everywhere else).

**7z. The panel is REAL (D86).** One call per stream to `/v2/analytics/brand-summary/posts`, stored per stream, drawn on the engine page (merged) and each stream page. Four tiles: impressions, interactions, engagement rate, posts. A missing metric prints "no data yet", never 0. Delta tiles are gone: a delta needs a previous window and the store keeps one by design. Pull is a button, not a cron, until it is boring. **Next: the frame ladder**, which needs the join below.

**7. Analytics in two places, always at the bottom. MOCK BUILT (D66), replaced in D86.** At the bottom of the engine page (aggregated) and at the bottom of every stream. Every field maps to something Metricool documents per post, so it is a promise about the real panel rather than decoration, and it is labelled `sample numbers` in amber with the reason underneath. Still a mock: item 8 below is what makes it real.

~~**7. Analytics in two places, always at the bottom.**~~ Marrs: *"on the main engine page, where it shows everyone, so it's an aggregation of all those stats. And when you go into each of the streams, each one of those streams has an analytics section also. I think it's always going to be the thing at the bottom, because you don't want to look at that first... I'd at least like a mock-up there at the moment, and we're talking about as much data as we can and making it as visual as possible."*

The two screens answer different questions and should not be the same tiles with a filter:

| Screen | Question | Compares |
|---|---|---|
| Engine page | Is the engine running, and whose | **Streams** |
| Stream page | Which frame works in this voice | **Post types** |

Two tiles are real from day one off our own calendar data with no Metricool at all: the **shipped heat grid** (weeks by network) and the **frame mix shipped**. Everything else needs the spike below.

The load-bearing tile is the **frame ladder**: each post type ranked by median reach within one voice, with the voice's own median drawn as a tick. That is the tile that answers "do my contrarian posts beat my listicles on my own audience", which is the whole Learn loop. It must print `n` per row and fade rows under n=3, because a frame with two posts behind it is a rumour.

Person and company voices must never be pooled in a ranking: a personal profile takes 63% higher engagement than a company page at similar impressions, so pooled, Polynize ranks below every human every time and teaches nothing. `streamKind()` already exists to branch on.

**8z. DONE (D98): `lib/marketing/url-join.ts` reads it nightly and on Pull now.** The second read for the join now has a proven endpoint (D84). `GET /v2/scheduler/posts?start&end&timezone` returns whole posts, verified against his account, and it carries `providers`, where `ProviderStatus.id` and `.publicUrl` live. That is the fallback join, no longer hypothetical. Note both dates must be full ISO datetimes.

**8. THE METRICOOL ANALYTICS SPIKE. ALL FOUR QUESTIONS ANSWERED, 28 August 2026.** Probe run against Polynize, Marrs and Shourov.

1. **Tier: AVAILABLE.** Every analytics endpoint returned 200 on his Advanced plan. The panel can be real.
2. **The join: the ids are different spaces, and we stored the wrong one.** Our `external_ref` is `367684553`, which is Metricool's own `ScheduledPost.id` (an integer). Their analytics `postId` is the platform URN, `urn:li:ugcPost:7498175968910561281`. **But the spec has the bridge:** `ProviderStatus` carries `id` AND `publicUrl` per network, and the analytics rows carry the matching `url`. At schedule time the post has not published so there is no provider id yet, so the fix is a SECOND READ after publication: GET the scheduled post, store `providers[].id` and `providers[].publicUrl`, and join on the url. That is an exact string match, not the fuzzy text-and-timestamp fallback that was feared. A nightly pull has to happen anyway, so this costs nothing extra.
3. **TikTok returns JSON, not CSV.** Real per-video metrics: `videoId`, `viewCount`, `likeCount`, `engagement`, `impressionSources`, `shareUrl`. No CSV parser needed.
4. **LinkedIn enumerates EVERYTHING, not just Metricool-published posts.** Marrs's feed returned 28 posts including his hand-posted ones, which is a bonus rather than a limitation: his manual LinkedIn is measurable, and D41's hand-posting decision does not blind us after all.

Also learned: a brand with no connection returns a clean `403 "There is no instagram connection for blog: 6530743"` (Shourov), which is a second and more direct way to detect connected platforms than the profile fields D78 uses. `/timelines` works per network where connected (Polynize) and 500s with a Metricool-side null where not, so it needs a connected-network guard before it is called.

**8a. The probe itself (D69, params fixed in D78).**

Open `/console/marketing/metricool/probe` (optionally `?stream=marrs&days=90`). Six GETs, nothing written, and it prints a verdict on each of the four questions below plus the raw body of every response. Send the page back and the next step is a build rather than a question.

Order of the build after it: probe, then OUR OWN snapshot store (not optional, see the constraints), then a nightly pull with backoff, then the panel swapped tile by tile showing "no data yet" rather than a zero, because a zero is a claim.

**8a. The original research, kept because the constraints below are the design.** Everything in item 7 beyond the two real-now tiles rests on assumptions that a single authenticated request would settle.

Good news first: **yes, per-post analytics are real.** Metricool publishes a complete OpenAPI 3.0.1 spec at `https://app.metricool.com/api/swagger.json` (527 paths, linked from their own docs). Documented per-post endpoints with full typed schemas:

- `GET /v2/analytics/posts/linkedin`: impressions, uniqueImpressions, clicks, likes, comments, shares, engagement, videoViews, timeWatched, plus the reaction breakdown (praise, empathy, interest, appreciation, entertainment)
- `GET /v2/analytics/posts/instagram`: reach, impressions, views, **saved**, shares, **follows gained from that post**, interactions, engagement, hashtags used
- `GET /v2/analytics/reels/instagram`: averageWatchTime, reelsSkipRate, durationSeconds
- `GET /v2/analytics/timelines`, `/aggregation`, `/distribution`: the account-level engine, every sparkline and KPI
- `GET /v2/analytics/brand-summary/posts`: cross-network per-post feed in one call

What the spike must confirm, in priority order:

1. **Is Marrs on Advanced or Custom?** API access is documented as those tiers only. If not, the whole analytics section is a permanent mock.
2. **Does the join work?** The Learn loop rests on `ProviderStatus.id` (returned when we publish, and already stored as `external_ref`) matching the analytics `postId`. Both fields are documented; **nowhere does the spec say they are the same identifier.** If they do not match, the fallback is matching on `publicUrl` or on timestamp plus text prefix, both fragile. This single assumption decides whether analytics closes the loop or is a vanity dashboard.
3. **Do TikTok and Threads return JSON or CSV?** Both paths have a 200 with no content schema and a summary saying "Download a CSV", while typed JSON schemas for them sit in the spec referenced by zero paths.
4. **Does LinkedIn enumerate everything?** Metricool's own limitations page hedges on listing all published posts. Likely fine for posts published THROUGH Metricool, which is the inference to test, and it matters because his own LinkedIn is hand-posted (D41) and therefore published outside it.

Known constraints to design around, not discovered later:

- **Every endpoint defaults to Europe/Madrid.** Pass `Australia/Sydney` on every analytics call or every day bucket is shifted 8 to 10 hours. Same trap as D24 on the publish side.
- **No rate limits published anywhere.** Third-party reports say 429 with Retry-After. The engine page aggregates every stream, so it needs our own throttle, backoff and cache, not live passthrough.
- **No per-post lookup exists.** Every analytics endpoint is a date-range list, so showing one piece's numbers means fetching a window and filtering our side.
- **Pagination is half-documented.** `page.next` comes back but no cursor parameter is documented for consuming it. A wide range may silently return one page.
- **We must store our own snapshots regardless.** Metricool scopes data to a BRAND and holds no notion of our narrative, piece or post type, and states no retention window. Without our own periodic pull keyed to calendar entries there is no history, no trend, and no way to answer "did the Emergent AI carousel outperform". Budget the store as part of the build.
- **YouTube per-video is missing.** No `/v2/analytics/posts/youtube`. The only own-channel path is `/stats/youtube/videos`, whose summary reads "This method is deprecated". YouTube is account-level only until tested.
- **The Advanced Analytics add-on gates the best path.** Per-narrative "campaign dashboards" exist and would be ideal, but `PerformanceDashboardDto.locked` is documented as true once the brand is past the free limit without the add-on. Build on the raw per-post endpoints and treat dashboards as an accelerator.

## Video: evaluate ChatCut before building more of our own (asked 25 August 2026)

**Posting an edit made elsewhere is no longer blocked (D80).** Whatever tool cuts the video, the finished file goes into a stream's media library as a Box direct link and "Post this" takes it from there. So the ChatCut question is now purely about the EDIT, not about whether the console can publish the result.


Marrs: *"for the video editing flow, I've found a possible better option called ChatCut. What I want to do when we get there is feed you a finished video I've created, and the raw video, and to see if our current video editing model or ChatCut can achieve the same thing."*

**A bake-off, not a decision.** He supplies a finished video he cut himself plus the raw footage, and the test is whether either path reproduces it: our own pipeline, or ChatCut.

Setup when we get there: **read `chatcut.io/claude` and install the ChatCut plugin.** Do not install it before the comparison is actually being run, and do not treat it as chosen: the point of handing over a known-good finished cut is that it is a real target with a real answer, which is a much better test than a feature list.

Worth knowing going in: everything after the shoot is deliberately absent from the console today (no cut, no render, no export, and no upload). So this is not "replace something that works", it is choosing what to build for a stage that does not exist yet, which is the right time to ask the question.

---

## Cadence and scheduling

**9. Nothing enforces capacity. ADDRESSED (D79), and the answer was a sentence rather than a limit.** `nextOpenSlots` still walks 60 days and always finds something, which is correct: the slots ARE the capacity, so a third LinkedIn post on a two-slot day lands tomorrow and nothing is double-booked. What was missing was anyone saying so. "Add to queue" now reports the depth when the slot it took is a week or more out, in amber under the entry rather than in coral, because a queue three weeks deep is a fact and not a fault. A hard cap was rejected: the whole point of the button is that he can press it repeatedly without thinking, and refusing at some invented depth would break that to prevent an outcome he may well have intended.

**10. The wave lock is per narrative, not per lane. FIXED (D64).** The lane now has its own lock, taken after the narrative lock and released before it, so two narratives on one stream take turns and the second sees the first's entries. Expires after two minutes, re-enterable by its own holder, fails OPEN if it cannot be written, and releases only if it is still ours. The optimistic re-check this item suggested was rejected: it costs a store read per entry and still cannot make read-compute-write atomic.

~~**10. The wave lock is per narrative, not per lane.**~~ Two narratives on one stream planned minutes apart can take the same slot: both read the calendar before either writes. The precedent for the fix is in the same file, where the ship branch already re-reads each entry fresh.

**11. Two timezone sources for one post. FIXED (D61).** The entry now carries the zone its time was chosen in, and publish sends that rather than re-deriving it. Entries planned before the stamp fall back to the old config, so nothing already live is reinterpreted.

What it was, kept because the shape recurs: the wave picked a time from `getChannelSchedule(lane).timezone` while `publishEntry` sent it paired with `getPostingSchedule()[stream].timezone`. Both default to Sydney so it was invisible. Typed slots (D46) made it categorical rather than cosmetic: the post the grid labels the morning video would have gone out in the afternoon. **The lesson to reuse: anything the wave decides must be stamped on the entry, not re-derived from config at ship time.**

---

## Known rough edges

**18. `touchscreen-concept-flip` still carries stale two-track guidance (D92).** Its `hook_recipe` has a labelled "On-screen text hook:" line against a format whose shape says the whole script is spoken words only. It cannot be deleted: `split_screen_short` has no `screenPromptShape` and a template has no screen-brief field, so those lines are the only copy of that guidance. **Needs a decision:** add a `screen_recipe` field to templates (correct model, touches the store, the editor and the screen-prompt path), or give the format a `screenPromptShape` and accept that the guidance generalises. Cost today is the prezie stage not seeing it, rather than a corrupted script, because the script prompt's hard constraints already drop screen notes the shape did not ask for.

**12. A calendar entry has no output identity.** The `texts_list` master serves both the listicle and the explainer, so unticking one and ticking the other leaves `missing` at 0 and the wrong draft stands in. The slot is always right; the copy can be wrong.

**13d. "Posted" on the calendar is inferred from the clock, not confirmed.** D85 labels a scheduled entry whose time has passed as Posted, which is what an operator needs to read, but nothing has asked the platform whether it published. The analytics second read (item 8z) is what makes it a fact, and it should REPLACE the inference rather than sit beside it, so the board never shows two different answers to the same question.

**13c. The calendar does not say what time a date-only post will take.** D83 makes it the channel's first free slot that day and stamps it back after scheduling, so it is visible afterwards. Showing it BEFORE the press needs the lane slots on the calendar client, which is one read per stream on that page. Small, and the same principle as printing the YouTube title (D82): a derived value the operator cannot see is a guess with extra steps.

**13b. A vertical YouTube post has to be switched to Short by hand. DONE (D84).** The token is lowercase `short`, read off two of his own posts through the probe rather than guessed, and the case is not consistent across their API (Instagram's is `REEL`, LinkedIn's is `POST`), which is exactly why it was read. The caption screen asks Short or landscape once, defaulting to Short, and stamps it on the entry. A landscape post sends no type at all, because that token is not in the data and the default already accepts horizontal. Still unsent: `videoThumbnailUrl`, which is how the first-frame-is-the-cover rule would be honoured through the API.

**13a. A door for work that is already finished. DONE (D80), first real run fixed in D81.** "Post this" on any file in a stream's media library mints a storyless piece on the caption screen, with the file attached and no platform preset. Idempotent per asset. The same fix repaired the rendered podcast clip, which was opening a finished film on the teleprompter. Five things that would have made it post wrongly are in D80: platforms were editable nowhere, `publish_mode` was ignored by both calendar buttons, YouTube posts had no title, the queue 500'd on a channel with no times, and the em-dash strip missed the one path where a human writes.

**13. Two competing routes into the calendar.** The wave, and "Prepare posts for N channels" on the text screen, which creates entries with no `scheduled_at` that the wave then has to repair. Marrs, on the two: "I don't see those two options as competing." He is right, and my framing was wrong: the problem is not that a queue and a specific time compete, it is that one route creates entries with no time at all. D79 made the queue button a real answer for those entries; the remaining work is that the route should not be producing timeless entries in the first place.

**14. The autosave can drop an agreed hook. FIXED (D63).** The loop now snapshots all seven fields, builds the PUT body from that snapshot, and compares it whole by value, so a field cannot be sent without being checked. Reproduced first: the trigger is a mid-flight change followed by a BLUR, because blur clears the debounce and then early-returns, leaving the loop's re-check as the only rescue. Before the fix: one PUT, stale value, "Saved". After: two PUTs, correct value. The Text screen was audited and does not have it.

~~**14. The autosave can drop an agreed hook.**~~ On the Script screen the save loop re-checks only the script and the media refs, so a hooks or title change landing mid-flight is never re-sent while the indicator still says Saved. "Propose the arc" then refuses with the hooks visibly ticked on screen. The image screen's autosave does not have this bug and is the pattern to copy.

**16. Two stores hold one lane's schedule. FIXED (D79).** The lane file is now the single authority and it has the UI: Connect Metricool edits per-network times and modes per stream, "Add to queue" and the wave both read that one table, and the timezone is written to both stores from one writer so they cannot drift. The old per-stream `slots` list is dead and no longer written to, but its existing values are carried over rather than cleared, since a dead field is not worth destroying data over.

What it was, kept because it is the shape of the bug: `pam/config/posting-schedule.json` held per-stream slots and had the only UI; `pam/channel-schedule/{lane}.json` held the per-network slots the wave actually used and was edited by nothing. So the operator could set times all day and change nothing that shipped. D68 patched the timezone half of it and I recorded the rest as an item rather than a bug, which undersold it: **a settings screen wired to a store nothing reads is worse than no settings screen, because it answers the question wrongly.**

**17. Nothing lints. FIXED (D75).** ESLint 9 flat config, narrow and correctness-only, gating the build via `prebuild`. Verified against the actual bug: D74 reintroduced temporarily produces an ESLint error and no TypeScript complaint. 20 pre-existing errors were fixed rather than suppressed. What it was: D74 was a function calling itself instead of reading a map, which TypeScript cannot catch (`string ?? x` is legal) and which left `LANE_VOICE` unused with nothing objecting. A configured `no-unused-vars` plus `no-constant-binary-expression` would have caught both halves at commit time. It cost a week of Gate 2 being dead.

**15. No test runner beyond two suites.** Still true, though the marketing suite has grown a long way: `npm run test:marketing` is 698 assertions now (was 111 when this was written) and `npm run test:blueprint`. Everything else is unverified by anything but a typecheck, and `tsc` cannot see a client component importing server code, which shipped a 500 once already (D47).
