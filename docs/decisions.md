# PAM — Decision Log

**What this doc is:** the load-bearing decisions behind PAM, and *why* each is the way it is. These are the things that look arbitrary or "improvable" to someone seeing the code cold — but each is deliberate, and reversing one without understanding it tends to break something. **If a change would contradict a decision here, stop and flag it rather than proceeding.**

Format per entry: the decision, the context that forced it, the rationale, and the consequence if it's violated.

**Last updated:** 2026-06-05

## D1 — Strict on generate, liberal on read

**Decision:** The capability-map has two schemas. The **generation** path (website intake) is strict (`capability-map-schema-v05.ts`, enum cluster types, required fields, validated). The **read/render** path (`schema-v2.ts`, `loadBlueprintV2`) is liberal (e.g. `cluster_type: z.string()` free-string), accepting broader real-world vocabulary and normalizing to canonical shapes on read.

**Context:** Generated data should be clean and canonical. But real data — hand-built, or produced by the transform — arrives slightly off-shape (different field vocabulary, string-vs-object arrays, enum values the schema hadn't seen). If the read path is as strict as generation, the Console returns null and the blueprint shows an empty state.

**Rationale:** The render path must *never* break on real data that's slightly off. Generation can afford to be strict because it controls its own output.

**Consequence if violated:** Tightening the read schema to match generation is **the recurring mistake that breaks live blueprints.** It has been tempting several times. Do not do it. If the read path is rejecting valid real data, widen the read path or fix the data — never tighten the read path toward the generation gate.

---

## D2 — Fix the data to canonical, don't widen the schema (for drift)

**Decision:** When transform-produced data fails the read schema, the default is to **normalize the data to the canonical shape** (using a real committed file as the reference), *not* to widen the schema to accept the drift. Widen only for genuinely-valid new vocabulary the schema legitimately should support.

**Context:** The lenient read schema was widened three times to absorb successive emulator outputs. By the third, it was eroding toward "validates nothing." Newkind's emulator produced **83 schema failures** — all of which were *drift* (invented shapes), not valid new vocabulary.

**Rationale:** A schema that accepts anything protects nothing. Drift (e.g. completeness value "DEFINED" instead of the canonical STUB/PARTIAL/COMPLETE, bare-list motion covers, wrong evidence shape) should be corrected in the data, not blessed in the schema. The proven move: classify each failure against a real committed file (EverStock is canonical) — DRIFT → fix the data; GENUINELY-VALID-BUT-UNSUPPORTED → widen.

**Consequence if violated:** Each unprincipled widen moves the schema closer to validating nothing, and the *next* transform drifts further because nothing pushes back. (Counter-example of a *correct* widen: `cluster_type: "parallel"` for reMYnd — a real concept the free-string read path already accepted, so no change was even needed.)

---

## D3 — Give the transform a real file as template, not a described schema

**Decision:** When producing Blueprint JSON via a transform (the manual emulator now, Ben later), feed it an **actual committed example file** as the "match this exact shape" template — not a paraphrased/described schema.

**Context:** Emulator runs given a *described* schema drifted badly (EverStock 26 issues, Newkind 83 issues). The reMYnd run, given a complete real EverStock capability as the literal template plus explicit array-vs-object / enum callouts, came back with **0 issues**.

**Rationale:** A model mimics a concrete example far more reliably than it follows a prose description of a shape. The real file is a hard contract; a description is an invitation to improvise.

**Consequence if violated / why it matters forward:** This is the spec for **Ben's** transform cognition — it must be anchored to the real schema as a contract, not a paraphrase. Ignoring this reintroduces the drift-and-reconcile tax (which cost real time four times over).

---

## D4 — The CWU invariant: every team is three tiers, always

**Decision:** Every engagement's agent team is exactly three tiers: **Human accountable lead → Team leader agent → Worker agents.** The team leader is auto-inserted on every team (an *additional* agent, not a promoted worker), with a standard coordinating/security/liaison role. Enforced at generation (the strict schema requires `team_leader` matching an agent name).

**Context:** The team leader is the connection point between Polynize, the client, and the agent team — the reporting/escalation channel and the security layer (ACTA team-lead role). It's not optional flavour; it's structural.

**Rationale:** Consistency and safety. Every team has a known coordination + escalation + security point. Making it a *required* field in the generation schema means the rule is **self-enforcing at the source** — you cannot generate a valid leaderless team.

**Consequence if violated:** If `team_leader` doesn't exactly match an agent's `name` (case-sensitive), the org chart **silently falls back to two tiers** — the rule is broken with no error. The match is the fragile point; guard it. (Roxbury was the sole grandfathered pre-rule exception, retrofitted with Mable as leader.)

---

## D5 — Readiness is phase-relative, and completeness is provisional

**Decision:** Readiness measures progress through the *current phase's* work (Build → work-plan sprint weighting; Modelling → 0.80 × analysis completeness + 0.20 × blocker resolution). The completeness metric driving Modelling readiness is explicitly a **provisional AI judgment**, marked as such in code.

**Context:** A single readiness formula across phases is meaningless (a Modelling engagement has no sprint; a Build engagement's completeness is settled). And the completeness values were set by the emulator/AI eyeballing "how well could I specify this from the notes" — not measured against a rigorous standard.

**Rationale:** Phase-relative readiness gives an honest signal per phase. Marking completeness provisional prevents false precision — a client reading "44%" shouldn't think it's a measured fact when it's an AI's impression. It becomes rigorous when Cognitive Studio / Ben define and assess against a real "what makes a capability complete" standard.

**Consequence if violated:** Removing the provisional framing creates false precision (the "looks measured, is actually impressionistic" trap). Applying the Modelling formula to a Build engagement (or vice versa) produces a wrong number. The dashboard and blueprint must use **one shared readiness module** — a past bug had two separate calcs giving 40% vs 66% for the same engagement.

---

## D6 — Blockers are the last mile, not the whole of readiness

**Decision:** In Modelling readiness, resolving critical blockers is the final 20%, not the whole. The bulk (80%) is analysis completeness. Blockers are the *closing segment* of the modelling work.

**Context:** A blueprint with full capability mapping but a couple of open blockers is *most* of the way done, not at zero. Treating "blockers resolved" as the whole readiness would read a well-analysed engagement as barely started.

**Rationale:** Mirrors the work-plan weighting logic (front-heavy, light tail). The understanding is the bulk; the last-mile decisions gate sign-off.

**Consequence if violated:** Conflating "blockers" with "all gaps" inflates the blocker count and tanks readiness. The gap-register split (blockers vs in-build) exists precisely to separate the last-mile blockers from the in-build work; only blockers drive the 20%.

---

## D7 — The gap register splits blockers from in-build work

**Decision:** Gaps are split into **Critical Blockers** (gate sign-off) and **Gaps to resolve in build** (real work, not sign-off blockers), via a per-row **Blocking** column (Yes/No). Items aren't deleted when they're "not blockers" — they're reclassified to in-build.

**Context:** The gap register was conflating two things: modelling sign-off blockers vs work to be done during the build. Real build tasks (e.g. "write persona 3 voice doc") were inflating the blocker count.

**Rationale:** Readiness should count only the sign-off blockers. Reclassifying (not deleting) preserves the record while removing build-work from the blocker count. The `blocking` flag is the source of truth; the renderer splits on it.

**Consequence if violated:** A plain `Blocks` column does **not** trigger the split (no substring match with "blocking") — this is intentional so the old column doesn't accidentally activate it. The footer format `**Status:** N gaps open · M blocking sign-off.` must use `·` or `•` as the separator or the parser misses it.

---

## D8 — Never fabricate; mark inferred and provisional

**Decision:** Transform output must trace to real source. Inferred content is flagged (`_inferred` in benchmark text, STUB completeness for under-defined capabilities, empty `evidence` arrays where no real quote exists). A "Real vs Inferred" review note accompanies each build for human eyes — and is **not** committed (it stays with Marrs).

**Context:** Early Roxbury content included CC-fabricated data. The discipline since: a partial-but-honest map beats a complete-but-fabricated one.

**Rationale:** Fabricated specifics ("we know your CAC is $5") are worse than honest gaps ("this benchmark is inferred"). Clients can see these (within-tenant), so honesty is also a posture choice.

**Consequence if violated:** Fabrication erodes trust and produces confidently-wrong blueprints. The subtler form is *false precision* — inventing exactness (a clean percentage, a specific number) where the input was impressionistic.

---

## D9 — Deploy Console before data (when schema changes)

**Decision:** When a change touches both Console code and engagement data, push the **Console first**, poll Vercel to success, *then* push the data. Data-only changes need no ordering.

**Context:** New-shape data read by an old schema fails to parse → the blueprint shows empty state. There's no staging environment to catch this (a known gap).

**Rationale:** The schema that understands the new data must be live before the new data is readable.

**Consequence if violated:** A window where production reads new data against the old schema → broken blueprint. This is a *manual* discipline standing in for a staging environment; it's fragile and depends on remembering it. (See the maturity report — proper staging removes the need.)

---

## D10 — blueprint.md is authoritative over the HTML diagram; only 5 sections render in 2.0

**Decision:** When `blueprint.md` and any HTML diagram diverge, `blueprint.md` wins. In 2.0, only 5 markdown sections render (`infrastructure`, `integrations`, `throughput`, `gap-register`, `sign-off`); the other 1.x sections are ignored and can be removed on migration.

**Context:** Several engagements carried stale 1.x markdown (old agent names, old narratives) in sections that the 2.0 renderer ignores — so they looked stale in the file but didn't render. The summary/capability-map/team now come from JSON.

**Rationale:** One source of truth for the rendered narrative. The dead sections are noise.

**Consequence if violated:** Editing a dead 1.x section and expecting it to render wastes effort (it won't). Conversely, the 5 live sections are the only place narrative edits take effect.

---

## D11 — Client-write paths are narrow, explicit, and unit-tested

**Decision:** Clients are read-only **except** two deliberate write paths: adding/editing-own-open Questions, and filling/signing their own SoW fields. Each is gated to the client's own slug, to the specific action only, and is unit-tested. Every other mutation requires team scope.

**Context:** Until Questions, clients were pure read-only. Opening write access is where access-control bugs live.

**Rationale:** Each new client-write capability is a risk surface; it must be the *narrowest possible* grant (this action, this slug, these fields) and proven by a test matrix, not just UI gating.

**Consequence if violated:** A loosely-built client-write route could let a client mutate things they shouldn't (status changes, other fields, other slugs). The pattern is: a pure, unit-tested authorization function (`authorizeQuestionUpdate`, `authorizeSowFieldEdit`, `authorizeSowSign`) + server-side enforcement, never UI-only.

---

## D12 — A signed SoW locks server-side; unlock clears the signature

**Decision:** Signing locks the SoW; the lock is **enforced server-side** (the field route returns 423 when locked, for client and team). Team can unlock, which **clears the client signature** (re-signing required). Regenerate on a locked SoW is blocked (423).

**Context:** The SoW is a legal agreement clients sign. A "locked" document that's only locked in the UI isn't locked.

**Rationale:** A signature must be invalidated if the document can change after signing — so unlock clears it. The lock must be real (server-enforced), or the API is a bypass. A signed agreement must never be silently overwritten by a regenerate.

**Consequence if violated:** UI-only locking = editable-via-API "locked" docs. Keeping a signature across an unlock-edit = a signature on a document that changed since signing (legally meaningless).

---

## D13 — "Support" stays the defined legal term; "Operate" is the commercial/lifecycle label

**Decision:** The §9.1 fee row and field *labels* use "Operate" (matching the Modelling → Build → Operate lifecycle). The Service Agreement legal clauses (clause 19, Schedules 2 & 4) keep "Support" as the defined legal term. The underlying field keys (`support_fee`, `support_period`) were kept (display relabelled only) so filled data isn't orphaned.

**Context:** "Operate" matches the engagement-phase vocabulary used everywhere else. But "Support" in the clauses is a defined legal term, cross-referenced, in reviewed copy.

**Rationale:** Renaming a defined term across legal clauses needs a legal review (risk of partial matches, broken definition links, changed legal meaning) — not a find-replace. The fee-row label and the legal term can differ for related-but-distinct concepts.

**Consequence if violated:** A blind "support"→"Operate" across the clauses risks an inconsistent/ambiguous signed contract. If the rename is ever wanted, it's a see-the-text-first, legal-eyes task. Renaming the field *keys* (vs just labels) would orphan already-filled data.

---

## D14 — The repos are the source of truth; commits are the write mechanism

**Decision:** Blueprint/SoW/engagement content lives as files in per-engagement GitHub repos, read live by the Console. There is no separate content database; committing to a repo is how content changes.

**Context:** This gives version history, auditability, and a clean contract for the eventual transform engine (Ben) to write into.

**Rationale:** Git is the audit log and the rollback mechanism for content. The Console rendering live from the repo means a push is immediately reflected (pages are `force-dynamic`).

**Consequence if violated:** Introducing a parallel content store without reconciling it to the repos creates two sources of truth. The intended automated future (Ben writing JSON into repos) assumes the repo *is* the destination.

---

## D15 — PAM pivots to a marketing engine; blueprinting moves to Cognitive Studio

**Decision (2026-06):** The PAM Console's primary purpose becomes the **marketing engine**. Capability mapping + blueprinting is being absorbed into **Cognitive Studio on polynize.io**, so PAM no longer owns that workflow long-term. The Console home is now a three-section launcher: **Marketing** (primary, incoming build), **Leads** (the polynize.ai funnel), and **Blueprinting** (legacy).

**Consequences already applied:**
- **Newkind, reMYnd, and Roxbury engagement repos were hard-deleted** (repo + git history) for the SOC 2 audit and because they are no longer active PAM engagements (Roxbury continues as a client, handled outside PAM). This supersedes D4/D12/D14 *for those three engagements only* — their data is gone by design.
- **EverStock is the sole remaining engagement** and stays under Blueprinting (active build). `everstock-build` (no console marker) is untouched.
- `CONSOLE_CLIENTS` fallback reduced to `['everstock']`; dynamic discovery still finds any repo carrying `.polynize/client-config.yaml`.
- Blueprinting disappears once EverStock wraps; Leads will likely change when **Salesforce** becomes the core CRM.

**Open:** the marketing engine's own design (a UX-flow + functional spec) is the next major project and will define that section's shell.

---

## D16 — April interviews in-console, and the agent connection is transport-abstract

**Decision (2026-07):** April's concept-extraction interview runs **inside the console** (the intake screen, top of the production spine), not over Slack. The console always hosts the interview via its own context-chat, calling April through the agent socket (`docs/pam-console/agent-socket-contract.md`). The connection is **transport-abstract**: the console does not know or care what runtime is behind the socket.

**Context:** We are mid **SOC 2 audit** and minimising Slack data flow. The interview — loosely imagined as a Slack surface — needs a home in the console. This also reframes **T5**: it was "the April draft round-trip through the socket"; it becomes "April plugs in at the intake screen and runs the interview → concept doc." Same socket work, now with a screen at the front of the spine (where concepts are *created*, filling the gap the Script screen currently assumes is already filled).

**Rationale:** Keeping the interview in-console keeps sensitive intake data inside the audited surface. Keeping the connection transport-abstract means Slack can be added later as an *additional* surface (post-audit) without a console rebuild — that becomes April's concern, not the console's. The context-chat primitive already shipped on the Script screen (T4) is the right reusable surface for the interview.

**Consequence if violated:** Building the interview against Slack, or hard-wiring a specific agent runtime into the intake screen, reintroduces the Slack data flow the audit is minimising and couples the console to one transport. Do not build console-only assumptions either (no "there is no Slack" logic) — build to the socket, stay agnostic. Sequencing is unchanged: the real April still lands via the Master Agent Builder before the round-trip is live (the interim OpenRouter stand-in fills in until then, per D1).

---

## D17 — Small structured data flows through the job contract; large blobs go direct to storage and return a ref

**Decision (2026-07):** Agents return **small structured results through the job contract** (April returns the concept Markdown on `/api/agents/jobs/[id]/complete`; the console writes it to the bucket). Agents that produce **large binary artifacts write them direct to storage and return a ref** (Mikey's rendered video/b-roll later: upload to the bucket, return the object key on complete). This is **one rule, not two patterns** — the split is driven by payload size, not by which agent it is.

**Context:** April-via-console (markdown through the API) and Mikey-direct-to-S3 (video refs) look like an inconsistency between two agents. They are the same principle applied to different payload sizes.

**Rationale:** The physical reason is you do not pipe gigabytes through a JSON API (request-size limits, function memory, latency). For small data, routing it through the contract keeps the **console the single writer** and lets it enforce owner-partitioning + keying server-side (the agent never needs storage credentials). For large blobs, that round-trip is infeasible, so the agent writes direct and hands back a ref the console records.

**Consequence if violated:** Routing large media through the job API blows request/memory limits. Routing tiny data direct-to-storage would force S3 credentials onto every agent box and lose the server-side owner enforcement the contract provides. When adding an agent, choose the path by artifact size, and keep the console the writer for anything small enough to pass through the contract.

## D18 — Metricool replaces Blotato + Windsor.ai (behind an abstraction, gated on a test); Palmier is craft-tier, never in the console

**Decision (2026-07):** The tail zone consolidates onto **Metricool** via its official MCP (`https://ai.metricool.com/mcp`, auth via OAuth or `METRICOOL_USER_TOKEN` + `METRICOOL_USER_ID`): **publishing** (Raph's socket, replacing Blotato) and **analytics** (Donnie's socket, replacing Windsor.ai). One platform, one MCP, one auth. Separately, **Palmier Pro is a craft-tier LOCAL tool and is NOT integrated into the console**; Descript remains the console's cloud editing engine.

**Context:** Both incumbents burned us on specific failures (Blotato publishing; Windsor is generic ETL, not social-native). Metricool does both halves, is social-native (per-post/reel engagement, best-time, competitors), and has a real video/Reels publishing engine. Palmier fixes the Higgsfield round-trip seam-glitches by generating b-roll in-timeline — but its MCP runs on `http://127.0.0.1:19789` (localhost, Mac-only), unreachable from the headless AWS console.

**Rationale + the gate:** Build both legs **behind an abstraction; do not hard-wire until the test passes.** The one risk that decides publishing: Metricool's MCP `post_schedule_post` reportedly sends `providers` as strings (`["linkedin"]`) instead of objects (`[{"network":"linkedin"}]`), so scheduling fails (READ works). **Before committing publishing, run the schedule test:** schedule one real (video/Reel, multi-network) post to a test account and confirm it lands. **Pass → Metricool for both.** **Fail → publishing routes through the Purple Horizons `metricool-cli` (open-source) instead; analytics stays on the MCP (its read side works).** Known analytics gap (not a Metricool fault, do not chase): skip-rate, retention curves, sends-per-reach are platform-native only, out of scope for automated pull. Plan: Metricool **Advanced tier** (~$53-67/mo) powers the API/MCP in production.

**Consequence if violated:** Hard-wiring Metricool publishing before the schedule test repeats the Blotato burn. Wiring **Palmier** into any console stage (Mikey's production socket, Treatment execution) is architecturally impossible from headless AWS — it is Marrs's local craft workflow, never a console backend. Keep the tier split: the console is the **scale tier** (cloud, agentic: Descript + Metricool); Palmier is **craft tier** (local, Mac). Both products are young; re-verify the flagged risks at build time. This is tail-zone work, deferred until Raph/Donnie are provisioned.

**Update (2026-07-09, with Marrs):** The console reaches Metricool via its **REST API with a token**, NOT its MCP. The MCP is built for an AI agent to call tools interactively and needs a login to authorize; the console runs **headless on Vercel**, where an interactively-authed MCP is absent (the alpha's "connectors absent in headless contexts" risk). Calling REST also lets us control the exact payload, which **sidesteps the `providers`-as-strings bug** this decision worried about. Metricool splits accounts by **brand** (Polynize, Marrs Coiro, …), so config is a **per-stream → Metricool brand-id map** (a stream maps to a Metricool brand), not one global id. Env: `METRICOOL_USER_TOKEN`, `METRICOOL_USER_ID`, and a per-stream brand-id map. See **D24** for the full publishing model. (This does not change D18's substance: Metricool is still the tail for publish + analytics, behind an abstraction; only the *interface* to it is REST, not MCP.)

---

## D19 — The Output-plan step is the top→middle pivot; treatment is format-specific; "shoot once, cut many"

> **PARTLY SUPERSEDED by D29 (2026-07-21):** the **"shoot once, cut many"** single-shared-recording model below is replaced by two purpose-built hero formats, each with its own capture. The Output-plan step as the top->middle pivot, and format-specific treatment, still stand.

**Decision (2026-07-08, aligned with Marrs):** Between the concept doc and the middle module there is a load-bearing **Output-plan** step: the owner selects **platforms + formats + ICP (per output)**. This is not a fan-out convenience — it determines *which* middle modules run **and how the script is written**. Full model in `pam-console/production-model.md`.

- **Unit model:** a concept → one **"production"** that owns (for video) a **single canonical recording** + a set of **format outputs**; each output is a piece running its format-specific module. **Video outputs share the one recording ("shoot once, cut many");** text/image outputs derive from concept + script.
- **Script authoring inputs:** concept + selected formats + ICP + **the stream's brand voice**; the script is the **shot-list** that yields the canonical recording.
- **Treatment is format-specific, NOT format-agnostic** — it lives inside a format's module, post-record. (Supersedes an earlier "format-agnostic treatment map" framing, which was wrong.)
- **v1:** video module wired; other formats selectable but "module coming." The flow must not assume video (most users lean non-video; Marrs is the main video user).

**Consequence if violated:** collapsing Output-plan back into a single "develop into a script" button (the current shortcut) hard-codes short-form video, breaks multi-format + ICP, and mis-authors the script. Building the treatment map as format-agnostic produces a screen that can't actually treat a specific output.

---

## D20 — Brand voice is per-STREAM, editable, referenced on every content creation

**Decision (2026-07-08):** Brand voice is keyed by **stream** (Polynize / Marrs / Shourov / Patricia), not by owner email — a concept is *for* a stream regardless of who is signed in. Each stream's home surfaces its **brand voice + brand guidelines** docs; they are **created via an April interview** and **editable/updatable**. Content creation in a stream (concept synthesis, the interview register, script authoring) reads that stream's brand voice.

- **Polynize** sources its voice from **polynize.ai/brand** (D6, live dependency) if pullable, else a platform copy. **Other streams** get a bucket doc created via April (seed her interview from Marrs's brand-voice master prompt).
- **Refactor note:** the current `getBrandVoice(owner-email)` + `pam/brand-voice-docs/{owner}/` keying moves to per-stream.

**Consequence if violated:** keying brand voice on the signed-in user means a Polynize piece written by any team member gets that person's voice, not the Polynize voice. Voice is the product; it must follow the stream.

---

## D21 — Content pillars are the style layer: pillar → blueprint → treatment; per-stream library; referenced on creation

**Decision (reaffirmed 2026-07-08):** A **content pillar** is a recurring **style within a format** (e.g. "Marrs Attacks", "Show and Tell", podcast). It was always in the spec (`ux-flow-v1.0.md` §4.7 + §5, `content-format-matrix.md`, `pillars` table in `0009`); integrated into the aligned model here. Production logic: **concept → framing → pillar (inside a format) → platform.**

- Each pillar has a **blueprint** = which format module + which treatment sub-modules + the pillar-specific specifics/style. **The Treatment stage swaps by pillar** — the pillar's fingerprint. Build a format's middle module once; a new pillar is a light specialisation (mainly its treatment recipe).
- **Referenced on content creation:** a piece for a pillar follows that pillar's predefined style/format (especially video — the script style + treatment come from the blueprint). So the Output-plan (D19) carries **pillar** alongside format + ICP, and script authoring + treatment read the blueprint.
- **Content-pillar library** is a **per-stream** stream-home core asset (alongside brand voice + guidelines), pillars in `active` / `developing` states. Demoted (config + ideation, not a daily-driver).
- **ICP archetype set** (from the brand-voice builder, `brand-voice-builder-prompt.md`): Organisational Architect · High-Stakes Operator · Revenue Accelerator · Talent Champion · Service Ops Leader (+ custom) — the taxonomy for the Output-plan ICP field.

**Consequence if violated:** ignoring the pillar when creating a piece produces off-style content (wrong treatment recipe, wrong register); the pillar blueprint is the recipe, the production spine is the kitchen. Treatment that doesn't vary by pillar collapses the thing that differentiates the styles.

---

## D22 — The authenticity line: human faces and voices are always real captures

**Decision (2026-07-08, with Marrs):** Polynize's product is amplifying **human** creativity, and the flagship concept is literally "Strip the AI out first." So a hard line on generative media:

- **Any output presenting Marrs or Shourov on camera or as the speaker is a real recorded capture** (footage / voice). No AI avatars, no full cloned-narration presented as them.
- **Generative video is licensed only for:** the b-roll world (the owned satirical "AI look" register on polynize.ai/brand), diagrams, cards/overlays, and an optional **disclosed, faceless** brand-owner explainer format (Polynize stream only, piloted before it earns a module).
- **`shorts_studio` (restyle-to-AI) is rejected for talking-head content** — it converts the authentic recording into an AI render, paying the full shoot cost while destroying the only thing the shoot buys.
- **Voice cloning is narrow:** surgical word/phrase repair inside Marrs's own approved recording (ear-approved), and dubbing/language transfer of finished pieces. Never a full cloned read presented as him.
- **Provenance is tracked:** every output carries a `provenance` marker (`human_capture | ai_generated | hybrid`) so a published piece always knows what it is. Per-piece AI exceptions (e.g. a satirical bit where the AI look *is* the joke) are allowed only when **explicit and disclosed**, never silent.

**Consequence if violated:** an AI-generated Marrs is self-refutation of the brand thesis; blurring human vs AI provenance is a reputational risk the brand cannot afford. This is why the answer to "can we just AI-generate the videos?" is: only the b-roll and the non-video formats, never the human on camera.

---

## D23 — Prove the spine with text first; Descript is orchestrated, not replaced (test-first)

**Decision (2026-07-08, with Marrs):** Reverse the earlier build order. Marrs is the primary user and video is the flagship, but **text is the cheapest way to prove the entire shared spine** (Output-plan step, approve gate, publish/track tail, the output data model) — all of which video also needs. Video adds only the expensive, prerequisite-blocked middle (Treatment Map + Descript orchestration + b-roll) on top of that same spine. So:

- **Build order:** Output-plan step (one-tap confirm) → **one text output module** (concept + script → post copy, one LLM call) → **tail** (manual publish now, Metricool per D18 when creds land) → **then** the video Treatment Map. Video routing to the existing Script screen stays live throughout; video is de-risked, not deprioritized.
- **The disagreement was never text-vs-video** — it was "what proves the shared plumbing fastest." Text has no middle, so it shakes out the skeleton in days without also debugging the Treatment Map.
- **Descript is kept and orchestrated, not routed around.** The alpha's #1 solved time sink was the raw→clean cut, *solved by Descript*; the friction to remove is **iteration latency**, not Descript. Wire Mikey to drive Descript's write surface (`import_media`, `prompt_project_agent`, `publish_project`) so routine cuts/republishes run agent-side, with the Descript UI as the human escape hatch for surgical fixes.
- **Test-first gate (Marrs):** brand fidelity and quality are non-negotiable, so **no reliance on `prompt_project_agent` until one real piece is run through it and Marrs eyeballs the cut + brand adherence.** It is a validated capability, not an assumed one. `explainer_video` (the free assembly/render backend) is likewise proven on one test piece before it becomes the compositor.

**Consequence if violated:** building the video middle before the spine means you debug the tail, the approve gate, the data model, and the Treatment Map all at once, and still cannot publish what you make. Routing around Descript re-opens a solved bottleneck to avoid a friction that is actually review latency.

---

## D24 — Publishing: the console is the hands, Raph is the brains; the calendar is console-owned; per-stream brand mapping

**Decision (2026-07-09, with Marrs):** The publishing tail has two layers, and they stay separate:

- **The brains = Raph (an agent):** the judgment. Which channels, what date, the best times for the audience, per-platform caption wording, and conversational rearranging ("move that to Saturday"). Raph *proposes and adjusts a plan*; he does not hold the Metricool connection.
- **The hands = the console:** once a plan is set, the console makes the actual Metricool REST call (D18 update). The console is the single writer to the outside world (consistent with D3/D17: agents reason, the console executes and holds the creds).

**The calendar is a console-owned surface**, not an agent's. It reads the console's own `calendar_entries` (one row per piece × channel), so the team can see what is coming up **before Metricool is even wired**. Each entry links back to its piece in the console and, once scheduled, out to its post in Metricool (there is no live platform URL until it publishes, so the Metricool link is the pre-live destination).

**Build order (publishing, chosen 2026-07-09):**
1. **Step 1 — console-side, no external dependency (built):** per-platform caption generation (April adapts the approved post per channel) + the calendar view (grouped by date, platform marks, links, manual date-set). Closes the loop visually; usable immediately.
2. **Step 2 — needs Metricool creds:** the console's hands call Metricool's REST API to actually schedule/publish; entries gain their live Metricool link + `external_ref`. Gated on the D18 schedule test (verify the first real post lands).
3. **Step 3 — Raph:** the chat layer that proposes and rearranges the schedule (using Metricool's built-in best-time data), talking to the console which executes.

**Analytics is per stream (feeds the top of the funnel).** Because Metricool splits by brand and each stream maps to a brand, performance data is **per-stream** and belongs on each stream's dashboard (Donnie's read side, D18). The loop back to the top — using what performed to shape the next concept/hook — is a later intelligence layer (it can also draw on the social-intel data source); noted, not built.

**Consequence if violated:** putting the Metricool connection inside an agent (rather than the console) scatters credentials and breaks in headless runs; treating the calendar as an agent surface loses the team's shared window; using one global Metricool brand id posts a stream's content under the wrong brand. Keep brains and hands separate, keep the calendar console-owned, and key the brand per stream.

**Update (2026-07-09, after the first real test):**
- **The queue is console-side.** Metricool's REST API exposes post-create + best-time analytics but **no queue / time-slot / autoschedule endpoint** (confirmed against their docs + the full-coverage CLI). So "Add to queue" is ours: per-stream **ideal time slots + timezone** stored as console config (`posting-schedule.json`), and Add-to-queue appends a post to the next open slot after the last queued one, then schedules it at that concrete time via REST. "Next in the queue, next in the queue."
- **Timezone gotcha:** Metricool's default brand timezone is **Europe/Madrid**; a post sent as 9am Sydney displayed as ~1am. Fix: the console sends each stream's configured timezone (default `Australia/Sydney`), AND the brand's timezone must be set to match in Metricool. Timezone is per-stream config on the Connect screen.
- **Raph is deferred (maybe unneeded).** Because Metricool holds the ideal-time behaviour via the console-side queue, the "schedule at best times / move things around" value Raph would add is largely covered. Marrs's call: do not build Raph now; revisit only if the queue proves insufficient in practice.

## D25 — Content Pillar Templates are the creative loop; concepts are living source documents

**Decision (2026-07-11, with Marrs):** The daily creative loop is: **pick a core concept → pick a Content Pillar Template (CPT) → the console guides you through only what the template can't know → queue.** This extends D19/D21: a CPT *is* a pillar with its blueprint made concrete, and **the template carries the plan** (platforms + format + ICP + register), so selecting one replaces the Output-plan form as the default path (the manual "custom plan" remains as the fallback).

- **A template declares three things:** *what you bring* (inputs, e.g. "the finished episode"), *what you get* (outputs, e.g. "a captioned short with a re-cut hook + first-frame thumbnail"), and *how it's made* (the production recipe / agent instructions, refined run over run — this is what lets agents one-shot the piece). Plus ICP, platforms, an example piece, and a lifecycle status (**active / developing / retired**) driven by real performance: keep what works, kill what flops.
- **Per-stream template library** alongside the brand-voice doc (a stream-home core asset), plus a **built-in starter library** (curated over time, e.g. from what performs on sandcastles.ai) that streams can borrow/copy from. A template shows its example before you commit to it; it doesn't go *active* until one real piece made from it was good.
- **Core concepts are living master documents:** multi-input (interviews, pasted docs, dropped .md files, later images), continually appendable, each feeding many pieces. Console gains (a) an **Import concept** door (paste a .md → concept in a stream) and (b) later an **"Add material"** action (April folds new input into the master doc, keeping a source list).
- **Media library is per-STREAM** (not per-user), like brand voice: a stream's photos/videos (faces for LinkedIn images, b-roll, direct in-console upload of a pillar recording) live with the stream and are drawn on at creation. Banked as the build after templates + living concepts.
- **Fireflies concept extraction is POSTPONED** (client-data security: meeting transcripts hold client-confidential material; keep that in an isolated Claude session for now). Marrs extracts manually → .md → Import. Method + learnings captured in `pam-console/concept-extraction.md`; the in-console design (candidate inbox + editorial charter + human promotion gate) is banked there for later. ICP archetypes not final yet — extracted concepts firm up when they are.

**Consequence if violated:** rebuilding the Output-plan form as the primary path re-introduces per-piece ceremony the template exists to remove; making templates rigid forms (no chat escape hatch) violates the "can't be a form" doctrine; keying the media library per-user splits assets from the stream whose content needs them; wiring Fireflies into the console before the security posture is designed leaks client-confidential context into the content engine.

## D26 — April skills placement, "Content Series" rename, and console design principles

**Decision (2026-07-13, with Marrs):**

- **April's hook + curiosity-gap skills live in two places.** The canonical docs are in the repo (`docs/pam-console/april-skills/hook-writing-v1.0.md`, `curiosity-gap.md`) and go to the Master Agent Builder for the real April agent. Because the console runs April's cognition console-side for copy/script tasks (its own prompt with April's key), a **condensed distillation** (`lib/marketing/hook-guidance.ts`) is injected into the script-chat and text-draft prompts so hooks improve now. The full docs are the source of truth; the fragment is kept tight so it does not bloat prompts. Rule of thumb for future April skills: canonical doc in the repo, condensed fragment injected only where that skill is exercised.
- **"Content Pillar" / "Templates" → "Content Series" in the UI.** "Pillar" is jargon; "series" instantly conveys *a recurring set of posts in the same style*. User-facing copy uses **Content Series** (library = the content-series library, each item a series); the internal code identifiers (`template`, `pillar`, `template_ref`, `content-templates/`) are unchanged to avoid a risky rename. Distinct from **stream** (the brand bucket: Polynize / Marrs / …), which keeps its name.
- **Console design principles (now canon):** (1) the per-screen back button (`BackLink`) goes to the PREVIOUS screen, not a fixed destination (fresh deep links fall back to the logical parent); the top nav ("§ PAM control centre") is the way home. (2) **Visual hierarchy**: sections are bordered panels with a clear title, so each block reads as its own unit (Marrs's ADHD-driven, best-practice requirement) — apply on every page. (3) **Light + dark themes**: a cream (not white) light mode toggled top-right and persisted; `--bg` stays dark (it is the ink for text on mint/coral accents, which stays dark in both themes), only neutrals flip. Secondary buttons use a light mint outline that brightens on hover, not a dark border that vanishes on dark bg.

**Consequence if violated:** re-pinning back buttons to fixed destinations reintroduces the "jumps to the top from anywhere" disorientation; dropping the bordered-section hierarchy makes pages hard to parse; changing `--bg` to cream in light mode turns every on-accent label unreadable; renaming the internal `template`/`stream` identifiers is a large, needless refactor (the rename is display-only).

**Amended 2026-07-20 (Marrs):** the UI term reverts from "Content Series" back to **"Content templates"**. "Series" did not hold up conceptually in live use — a template is a *reusable recipe* you mash with a concept, whereas "series" implied a fixed run of episodes. Display strings across the stream page, the template manager, and the concept create/develop flow now read "template(s)". Code identifiers were already `template` / `template_ref` / `content-templates/`, so this remained display-only (no refactor), exactly as the original rename was.

**Also 2026-07-20:** the console back button now shows a second **"Dashboard"** link beside it (in the shared `BackLink`) going to `/console/marketing`, as a reliable "I'm lost, take me home" escape. This does not change principle (1) — the primary Back still steps through history; Dashboard is an explicit, always-present home.

## D27 — The media library stores references (Box.com live links / public URLs), not binaries. Amends D2.

**Decision (2026-07-14, with Marrs):** The per-stream media library stores **references** to files hosted on Box.com (or any public direct-download URL), **not uploaded binaries**. The console never handles the bytes: Box holds the file and serves a stable public "Direct Link", and Metricool fetches it by URL at publish time. A media asset is small JSON (`{ url, kind, label, stream, owner }`) that rides the existing bucket-or-interim dispatch, keyed per-stream at `pam/media-library/{stream}/{id}.json` (mirrors the template store). **This amends D2**, which had put heavy media as blobs in the private Lightsail bucket.

- **Why Box, not the Lightsail bucket:** Metricool ingests media by *public URL*. The Lightsail bucket is **private and text-only** (no presigner installed, no binary put), and Vercel's ~4.5MB request-body cap rules out proxying a video upload through a route. Presigned GET URLs would work but **expire** (S3 max 7 days), which breaks posts scheduled further ahead. Box gives large-file upload via its native apps, a stable non-expiring Direct Link (`/shared/static/<hash>.<ext>`), and it is on Marrs's existing **1TB Business account** (2TB/file/month bandwidth; and Metricool downloads the file *once* to re-host on the platform, so shared-link bandwidth is a non-issue). Net effect: the whole binary-storage problem disappears.
- **Data flow:** `piece.media` (asset ids) → `prepare` copies them onto each `CalendarEntry.media` → `publish.resolveMediaUrls(entry.stream, ids)` resolves to current public URLs → Metricool's `media` field (which the client already supported; it was hardcoded empty).
- **v1 is paste-a-link:** add a Box Direct Link (or any public URL) in the stream's Media library; it becomes selectable on the piece screens and rides to the post. **Banked fast-follows:** in-console upload straight to Box (chunked API + downscoped token), and Box-folder auto-sync (a CCG service app listing a folder and auto-creating Direct Links).
- **One empirical gate before trusting video:** Box Direct Links for large video can 302-redirect to `dl.boxcloud.com`; confirm Metricool follows it and ingests the video with one real test post before relying on it.

**Consequence if violated:** routing media back through the private Lightsail bucket reintroduces the presigned-URL-expiry problem (breaks advance-scheduled posts) and the CORS + large-upload problems Box sidesteps; storing bytes in the console at all hits the Vercel body cap; keying the media library per-user instead of per-stream re-splits assets from the stream whose content needs them (violates D25).

## D28 — Permissions layer (admin vs user): scoped, DEFERRED

**Decision (2026-07-20, Marrs): capture the intended two-tier model now, build it later.** D4 deferred permissions; Marrs has now articulated the target model but chose to DEFER the build to keep momentum on the video module. Captured here so it is ready and not re-litigated. Nothing was built for it yet (the Move-concept and dev-group Delete controls shipped ungated; they become admin-only when this lands).

- **Two tiers inside 'team':** admin (Marrs) and user (other team members). Determined by an admin-email allowlist (new env, e.g. `CONSOLE_ADMIN_EMAILS`, mirroring `CONSOLE_ALLOWED_EMAILS`). Safe default: if unset, everyone stays admin (today's behaviour), so nothing breaks before it is configured.
- **Admin:** sees and accesses ALL streams; can move concepts, delete concepts, delete dev groups, and edit the global built-in series.
- **User:** sees ONLY Polynize + their own stream (needs an email->stream map, mirroring `CONSOLE_CLIENT_EMAILS`); can create content, copy concepts into their own stream, and edit their own stream's assets; CANNOT move or delete core concepts, delete dev groups, or edit the global built-in series.
- **Editing the built-in series is inherently admin + global.** The built-ins are shared code constants (`lib/marketing/template-library.ts`), so global editing needs an OVERRIDE STORE (persist admin edits that shadow the constants for all streams). Per-stream refine already exists (Copy to this stream -> edit; the stream copy shadows the built-in via the kept `library:{id}`). So global built-in editing ships WITH this layer.
- **Enforcement is server-side, not just hidden UI:** every admin-only action's route must reject non-admins, and stream reads/writes must check the caller's visible streams. Hiding a button is not access control.

**Consequence if violated:** shipping an admin-gated action's UI without the server-side gate leaks it to users; shipping global built-in editing ungated lets any user rewrite shared recipes for everyone (the exact reason it must be admin-only); keying user visibility per-user without the email->stream map has no source of truth.

## D29 — Two purpose-built hero formats (9:16 split-screen, 16:9 screen-record). SUPERSEDES "shoot once, cut many" (D19)

**Decision (2026-07-21, Marrs):** Stop deriving short and long form from one canonical 16:9 recording. **"Shoot once, cut many" (D19) is superseded for video:** short and long form are fundamentally different pieces of content, and forcing one capture to serve both is where the friction lives. Instead there are **two purpose-built hero formats**, each with its own capture setup, script shape, and assembly. Lock these two workflows first, then expand. D19's other elements (the Output-plan step as the top->middle pivot, format-specific treatment) still stand; only the shared-single-recording model is replaced.

**The visuals live on the touchscreen, not in post.** The load-bearing insight: instead of generating graphics and compositing them onto video per piece, the **32in touchscreen IS the visual layer**. Marrs interacts with it live and the camera / screen recorder captures it. This converts "make visuals" from a per-video generation problem into a repeatable capture, which is what makes real volume possible off one setup.

- **9:16 Split-screen short (`split_screen_short`) — the HERO, built first.** One setup, two angles: TOP half a mid front shot to camera, BOTTOM half a bird's-eye of the touchscreen. Both halves on screen throughout. Representational visuals only: one big bold idea per beat, readable in a thumbnail, never a bullet slide. Each touch does one legible thing that reinforces the spoken line. 45-75s.
- **16:9 Screen-record long (`screen_record_long`).** Same room, but the screen is captured as a clean SCREEN RECORDING for fidelity. Opens full screen on the presenter, then switches to the screen recording with the head in a PIP circle, cutting to the overhead angle when the physical touch is the point. 4-8 min.
- **The simple vertical stays** (`short_form_video`, relabelled "Short-form video (simple vertical)"): single mobile 9:16, simple cut, music, captions. The everyday lightweight option, not a hero.

**AMENDED 2026-07-21 (same day, Marrs) — the SCRIPT and the TREATMENT are two separate artifacts, and Treatment is a PRE-RECORD stage.** The first cut of this decision put the screen brief inline in the script (`SPOKEN:` / `SCREEN:` per beat). That was wrong for a concrete reason: the teleprompter renders `piece.script` verbatim ([teleprompter/page.tsx](../app/console/marketing/piece/[id]/teleprompter/page.tsx) splits on blank lines and shows every block), so the presenter would be reading screen directions aloud. Marrs caught it. The fix honours BOTH prior positions:
- **The script is SPOKEN-ONLY.** Beat labels + the words. It is a teleprompter document; nothing that is not spoken appears in it.
- **The screen plan is its own artifact** with its own **stage** (`treatment_map`, which already existed in `lib/marketing/stages.ts` between Script and Record, marked "soon" — this fills it in). It is the brief handed to the animation build.
- **Named the SCREEN PROMPT (Marrs, 2026-07-21).** It prompts twice over, which is the point of the name: its cues prompt the presenter's gestures during the take, and it is the prompt the animator builds the HTML page from. Sits naturally beside Script and Teleprompter. Route `piece/[id]/screen-prompt`, LLM delimiter `===SCREEN PROMPT===` (the legacy `===TREATMENT===` spelling is still parsed so an in-flight draft cannot lose its plan). **The stored field stays `piece.treatment`** and the stage id stays `treatment_map`: display-only rename, so already-drafted pieces are not orphaned (same pattern as D26's series/templates rename).
- **It is a full HTML BUILD BRIEF, not a sketch** (Marrs, after the first animator handoff came back "a bit simple"). Every Screen Prompt opens with three global sections — **BUILD BRIEF** (one self-contained HTML page, fullscreen on the 32in touchscreen, one state per beat, gesture-advanced), **DESIGN SYSTEM** (Space Grotesk 700, the real palette, and the tactile depth language: one upper-left light source, three elevations only, raised cards vs recessed wells, decisive motion with no crossfades per the standing no-fades rule), and **OPERATOR STRIP** — then one state per beat carrying six enforced fields: `COMPOSITION` / `TYPE` / `COLOUR` / `MATERIAL` / `MOTION` / `GESTURE` / `CUE`. Loose fields produced thin briefs; naming each one forces specificity.
- **The OPERATOR STRIP is the presenter's own cue line**, rendered by the page itself: pinned to the bottom edge, ~14px uppercase cream at 6-8% opacity, no panel, updated per state, never animated. Legible to Marrs standing over the screen, effectively invisible on camera. Cues are four words or fewer (`TAP CENTRE TO SPLIT`).
- **SAFE AREA is format-specific**, which the 9:16-vs-16:9 capture decision forces: in the split-screen the touchscreen occupies the bottom half of a 1080x1920 frame, i.e. a **1080x960 near-square (9:8)**, so composition must be centre-weighted with nothing important within 12% of the side edges (a full-width 16:9 layout would lose ~37% to letterboxing or be side-cropped); in the 16:9 screen-record the full width is usable, but the PIP corner and the bottom cue strip stay clear.
- **The Screen Prompt is generated on its OWN stage, from the LOCKED SCRIPT plus the operator's DIRECTION** (revised 2026-07-21 after the first real animator handoff). The original design generated both in one pass with the script; in practice that produced briefs that were generic and only loosely tied to the words, because **the screen design is a creative decision the operator owns**. Marrs: "I need this opportunity to talk through what I want the graphics to look like before the prompt gets created." So the flow is: script (fine as is) → Screen Prompt stage, which **starts blank** and carries an April **direction chat** plus a **Generate / Regenerate from script** button. The generation reads the locked script beat by beat, the concept (for facts), the stream brand voice, the operator's direction, and the current brief when regenerating (so a follow-up refines rather than restarts). **The operator's direction WINS** over the model's own ideas; the model fills in only what was left open. `lib/marketing/screen-prompt.ts` + `piece/[id]/screen-prompt/generate`; `draftVideoScript` is script-only again.
- **A state may carry no text at all.** The earlier contract forced exact words on every state; a purely visual moment (three pillars, no caption) is often stronger, especially the opening, so `TYPE: none` is explicitly allowed. Texture is invited too (grain, pixelation, eroded edges, glow), and generated images can be embedded now that the console has image generation.
- **Treatment moves from post-record to PRE-record for these formats.** D19 placed treatment post-record (b-roll/overlays applied to footage) and D21 made the Treatment stage the pillar's fingerprint (naming "split-screen" explicitly). Both still hold, but the touchscreen format changes the timing: the screen visual must be BUILT BEFORE the shoot because the presenter touches it live on camera. It is a prop, not post-production. The separate post-record `treatment` stage (overlays/captions on the footage) remains for what genuinely is post.
- This preserves the standing principle that visual decisions are made at **script time, not discovered at edit time** (the asset-kit lesson: reactive visual decisions cost ~10 iterations). Front-loading is kept; only the artifact boundary changed.

**Scripts are generated as two tracks.** A script for these formats carries, per beat, a `SPOKEN:` line (the words) and a `SCREEN:` line (what is on the screen, the touch interaction, the transition). The SCREEN track is simultaneously the delivery guide, the **brief the animation build works from** (Marrs develops animations in a separate chat from this script), and the instruction for assembly. Implemented as `FormatDef.scriptShape` — the format owns its PHYSICAL output shape (how it is shot/assembled), which is kept separate from a template's recipe (its editorial structure); when present it replaces the default script shape in the draft prompt.

**Assembly (agreed, build after Phase 1):** import the two files from a **local studio folder** (no cloud; Box upload as the backup path for shoots away from the studio); **sync the two angles by audio** (both cameras record the same room sound, so alignment is automatic, no slate needed); **cut** to clean takes in Descript (its proven strength); **composite** the split-screen and the PIP with a **deterministic ffmpeg template** (fixed geometry, exact every time, per the same lesson as the text overlay: precise repeatable layout is a deterministic render, never a hand placement or an AI guess).

**Consequence if violated:** reverting to one shared recording reintroduces the compromise this replaces (a take that serves neither format well); generating and compositing graphics per piece instead of capturing the screen puts the bottleneck back into post and kills the volume this setup exists to produce; putting the format's capture shape into template recipes (instead of `scriptShape`) means every template has to restate the rig and they drift; **putting screen directions back into `piece.script` makes the teleprompter unreadable** (the presenter reads them aloud), and generating the treatment in a second, separate call lets the two artifacts drift out of lockstep.

## D30 — The console BUILDS the touchscreen deck in-house, on an unlisted URL. Replaces D29's animator handoff

**Decision (2026-07-21 to 2026-07-27, Marrs):** The Screen Prompt no longer briefs an external animator. **The console builds the deck itself** and serves it at an unlisted URL the studio machine opens and performs to camera. D29's Screen Prompt stage survives; what it produces changed, from a prose brief handed to a person to a plan the engine realises.

The trigger was pure friction. Marrs: *"I'm having trouble with the process of handing off the animator prompt to the external chat, can we just create the animation file inside this interface somehow instead?"* The handoff cost a round trip per revision, and the first one came back *"a bit simple"* because a brief can only describe a house style, never enforce one.

**The engine owns the look; April only decides content.** [`lib/marketing/deck.ts`](../lib/marketing/deck.ts) holds the entire house style and exports a small class vocabulary (`DECK_VOCABULARY`) that the generation prompt is written against. April picks content, sequence and gesture choreography and nothing else, so **a generated deck is on-brand by construction**. This is the same principle as the deterministic text overlay (D29 change log, 2026-07-21): precise, repeatable visual standards are a render, never a prompt.

- **The store holds STATES, not HTML.** [`deck-store.ts`](../lib/marketing/deck-store.ts) persists the state list at `pam/decks/{pieceId}.json`, and the route renders it through the current engine on every request. Improving the house style therefore upgrades every deck already built, with no regeneration and no LLM spend.
- **Keyed by PIECE ID ALONE**, unlike every other store in PAM, which is owner-scoped. It has to be: the URL is unauthenticated, so there is no owner to scope by at read time.
- **The URL is deliberately UNAUTHENTICATED** ([`app/console/deck/[id]/route.ts`](../app/console/deck/[id]/route.ts)), Marrs's explicit call: *"let's just make it an unlisted link."* The studio machine opens it and performs, with no console login in the shot. The id is a uuid so the link is unguessable, and a deck is pre-publication marketing material. Being a **Route Handler** it bypasses the `/console` layout's sign-in gate, which is what makes this possible inside the console tree at all. `cache-control: no-store`, because the performer may reload mid-shoot.

**The house style is an OSCILLOSCOPE** (Marrs, after developing the direction with April: *"we went with an oscilloscope vibe, make it feel a little oscilloscopic, full screen, like it's feeling vintage"*): a graticule with a brighter centre cross, phosphor persistence trailing the figures, CRT glass curvature and vignette, and corner telemetry readouts (`X-Y 1.00 V/DIV`, `TIME 5 MS/DIV`) so a number on screen reads as instrument output rather than a caption. This replaced the earlier crosshatch-blueprint substrate.

**The animation language is CYMATICS and LISSAJOUS figures**, Marrs's direction, and it carries meaning rather than decoration: a Chladni pattern is what a surface does when it is driven at a new frequency, which is exactly what a gesture does to the deck. Each gesture triggers its own figure, so the transitions ARE the gesture language:

| Gesture | Figure | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| tap | hard cut | the quiet advance |
| double-tap | a reticle snaps shut | committing to a conclusion |
| swipe-left / right | a Lissajous curve sweeps the frame | advance / go back |
| swipe-up / down | the plate resonates, a Chladni pattern reorganises | a structural shift |
| pinch | concentric rings pull in | narrowing to a detail |

**"Less is more"** (Marrs): the flash lives in the transitions and the hand, not in the states. A state is one idea, huge type, no bullet list.

**A deck is FOUR to SIX states, enforced in CODE and not only in the prompt.** The first real deck came back at **26 pages** because my own instruction said one state per beat and never skip. Marrs: *"the first pass is just way overcomplicated."* The prompt now asks for the four to six turning points the argument actually pivots on, and `generateDeck` additionally slices to `MAX_STATES = 6`. A prompt rule is a preference; a slice is a guarantee.

**The plan is SLIDE CARDS, not prose** (Marrs: the prose brief was *"too, too difficult to read"*). The Screen Prompt stage is two columns: the script split into its sections on the left, and on the right a card per slide carrying **the only two things a human decides, what is on screen and what it says**. Add, edit, reorder, delete by hand, or ask April for a set. Everything technical stays hidden and is applied by the engine. Slides persist as JSON on `piece.slides` ([`lib/marketing/slides.ts`](../lib/marketing/slides.ts)) and are **authoritative over the prose brief** when they exist; `piece.treatment` remains the fallback so older pieces still build. The prose BUILD BRIEF / DESIGN SYSTEM / OPERATOR STRIP preamble that D29 specified was written for the animator and is now vestigial: the engine already knows all of it, and printing it only made the panel unreadable.

**Deck content must never leave the display** (2026-07-27). Marrs shot a deck whose headline was clipped off the top and whose pillars ran past the bottom. The cause was a composition sized from WIDTH (`aspect-ratio` on a width-driven flex child), so a wide screen produced a pillar taller than the viewport. Two rules now: **every dimension that can grow is capped against viewport HEIGHT as well as width**, and the engine **measures each state after render and scales it down if it would still overrun**. The measurement is belt and braces on purpose, because deck content is generated and its size cannot be predicted, and anything spilling off the display ruins a take. Related: a state's label always renders in cream, with the pillar's tint carrying the semantic colour, since a coral label on a coral-washed pillar vanishes on camera.

**Colour is mandatory, not optional** (2026-07-27). The first real deck came back monochrome, because the vocabulary listed `dim` (recede) inside the colour list, so the model read "recede" as an alternative to a colour role and left elements uncoloured. `dim` is a STATE that composes on top of a colour (`class="pillar coral dim"`), and every element that carries meaning takes a role: the problem coral, the tension amber, the proof gold, the resolution mint, held constant across states. A monochrome deck throws away the fastest signal the format has.

**Consequence if violated:** going back to an external handoff reintroduces a round trip per revision and a house style that can only be described and never enforced; storing rendered HTML instead of states freezes every existing deck at the engine version that built it; scoping the store by owner or putting the deck behind the sign-in gate breaks the unlisted URL, which is the whole delivery mechanism; letting the state cap live only in the prompt returns the 26-page deck; and letting a layout size itself from width alone puts content off the edge of the screen, which is only discovered when a take is already ruined.

## D31 — The touchscreen is an INTERFACE, not a slide deck. SUPERSEDES D30's slide model

**Decision (2026-07-28, Marrs, after performing the first real deck):** *"We've built it with the concept of slides when it's not supposed to be a slide presentation. It's about navigating around the interactive HTML, not going through a series of slides. It doesn't present right."*

**The reason it does not present right is OBJECT IDENTITY.** A slide deck destroys and recreates: state 2 is a different picture that happens to also contain a pillar. An interface transforms: the *same* pillar moves, grows and opens. An audience reads that difference immediately, because only one of them looks like a thing being operated rather than advanced. No amount of transition polish buys it, since what is missing is the continuity of the object, not the quality of the cut. D30's whole artifact model (states, an index, per-state HTML, gesture-driven advance) is therefore the wrong shape and is superseded.

**A scene is not a list of states.** It is one set of objects that exist for the whole piece and are never rebuilt, plus a view state saying which one is open and what has been revealed on it. `lib/marketing/scene.ts`:

- **CONCEPT** the headline over the board. It recedes when a node opens rather than disappearing, because the board is still there behind what you opened.
- **NODES**, two to four objects side by side. Each has a label, a colour role, a line shown when it opens, and up to four **FACTS** (a label that waits, and a value revealed on touch).
- **CLOSE**, the line worth remembering, raised over the board rather than replacing it.

**Motion is FLIP, and that is the load-bearing technique.** Measure where every object is (First), change the layout class (Last), invert the difference with a transform, release it (Play). The objects are never re-created, so the eye follows one continuous thing instead of seeing a cut to a new picture. Everything else in the engine is in service of that.

**Interaction is direct, not global.** Touching an object opens it; touching a fact reveals it; touching another object in the rail switches straight to it; touching the open object again, or swiping down, closes it. There is no next and no previous. A receded object stays on the board, shrunk and quiet but still touchable, so the set is never lost and switching is one move. Swipe up from the board raises the close line. Number keys, space and arrows do the same things for reviewing a scene in the console without a touchscreen.

**April supplies DATA ONLY** (`SCENE_VOCABULARY`): nodes, colours, lines, facts. No classes, no layout, no markup. The engine owns every pixel and every behaviour. This is what finally makes a generated scene predictable, and it retires a whole class of problems at once: content cannot run off the display, a generated state cannot lay itself out wrongly, and "remove the other pillars' names when one is focused" stops being something to ask for because the engine already does it.

**A NAME IS EARNED, NOT GIVEN** (Marrs, 2026-07-28). The board opens as unnamed shapes. An object's name appears only once the presenter has opened it, and then stays for good, so the board fills in as he works it. Reading all three names before he has said anything gives the argument away; revealing each at the moment he covers it means the audience learns the set from him rather than from the screen. It also gives the board a visible sense of progress, which the operator cue now counts ("2 TO GO").

**The close breaks where it was written to break.** Newlines in `close` are deliberate: it is the one piece of copy whose shape is the point ("Build a human" landing on its own line, "then amplify with AI" underneath), so it is authored, never left to wrapping.

**Content must work in ANY order.** No node may depend on another having been opened first, and no fact may read as "and then". This is a real constraint on the writing, and it is the price of the interface reading as one.

**THE TYPE FLOOR IS ABSOLUTE** (Marrs, 2026-07-28, set by eye against the real cut). The fact VALUES ("HIGH", "DECLINING") are the smallest anything may ever be on this screen, because in a 9:16 split-screen the board occupies half a phone screen. Everything is a deliberate multiple of `--t-floor` so the hierarchy survives at any viewport instead of collapsing into one middling size, and the headline is deliberately exaggerated. The fact LABELS sit AT the floor: their hierarchy against the values comes from weight and colour, never from shrinking them away.

**NO PROSE ON A NODE** (Marrs, 2026-07-28). An open node first carried a sentence explaining it. That is exactly what the presenter SAYS, so the audience was reading what they were being told, and it was the only variable-length element on the panel, which is what crowded the facts: *"we don't need it, that's what's on the script."* Removing it is why the panel now holds only fixed-size elements and fits by construction, and it bought enough room to make the values the biggest thing on the card. **The screen carries the name and the numbers; the explanation lives in the script.** A label is at most three words, a value at most two.

The remaining fit routine is a backstop, not a layout mechanism: it earns its keep only when four facts carry labels long enough to wrap, and it spends the LABELS' headroom down to the floor, never touching a value or a title. If it reaches the floor and still does not fit, the copy is too long, not the layout.

**The clincher is a real control, not a swipe** (Marrs, 2026-07-28). A swipe is invisible: it gave the last move of the piece no affordance on screen and nothing for the presenter's hand to go to on camera. So there is a glowing mint button parked bottom right, present through the whole piece, that lands the closing line. It is UNLABELLED on purpose, so it cannot spoil the line it is about to deliver, and it hides while an object is open, because then the hand belongs on the object.

**The console is wired to it** (2026-07-28). `scene-store.ts` holds the DATA keyed by piece id alone, so the unlisted URL needs no owner and improving the engine lifts every scene already built. `scene-generate.ts` has April read the locked script, the concept and the brand voice and return data: concept, objects, colour roles, facts, close. The caps (4 objects, 4 facts) are enforced in CODE as well as the prompt, per the lesson of the 26-state deck: a prompt rule is a preference, a slice is a guarantee. An unrecognised colour falls back BY POSITION rather than to one default, so a set can never come out monochrome. `/console/scene/[id]` serves it, unauthenticated, exactly as the deck route did.

**The Screen Prompt stage is now a data editor, and that is the point.** It carries the concept line, a card per object (name, colour role, fact rows) and the close. There is nothing about layout, size, motion or gestures, because the engine owns all of it. **Changing a word is TYPING, and costs no LLM call**: under D30 a small fix meant a rebuild that re-decided every state, which is what made minor edits feel impossible ("I need to remove text from certain slides, and I'm not sure how to do that"). April proposes and refines; she is never in the way of an edit. The preview is the real page in an iframe at `?node=N`, not a mock-up, so what is reviewed is what the camera will see.

**The stage is called the INTERFACE** (Marrs, 2026-07-28), renamed from "Screen Prompt", which was itself renamed from "Treatment". The name kept describing a DOCUMENT because that is what the artifact used to be: a prompt written for an animator to build from. It is not a document any more, so: *"screen prompt seems a little weird now, the mental model is this is the interface for this piece of content."* Route `piece/[id]/interface`, and the old path redirects rather than 404s, because the stage gets bookmarked and left open in a tab for days while a piece is in production. **The stage id stays `treatment_map` and the stored field stays `piece.treatment`** through all three renames: display-only, so no piece in flight is orphaned (the same rule as D26's series/templates rename).

**The rename forced the dead deck builders out.** Moving the directory would have created `interface/deck/`, which is actively misleading, and those four unreachable endpoints (`deck`, `deck/revise`, `slides`, `generate`) were the only things keeping `deck-generate.ts`, `deck-revise.ts`, `slides-generate.ts` and `screen-prompt.ts` alive, so all eight are gone. `scriptSections` was the sole surviving export of `slides.ts` and moved to `script-sections.ts`. **The deck PLAYBACK path is deliberately kept**: `deck.ts`, `deck-store.ts` and `/console/deck/[id]` still serve any deck already built, so a deck can still be performed, it just cannot be built. That is the fallback until a piece has been shot with a scene.

**Consequence if violated:** reintroducing an index, a next gesture, or per-state generated HTML brings back the slide deck and with it the thing Marrs saw on camera. Rebuilding objects instead of moving them loses the continuity that is the entire point, however good the transition looks in isolation. Letting April emit markup again puts layout failures and off-screen content back into a generated artifact that nobody reviews until the shoot.

## D32 — A piece needs three inputs: the concept, the template, and the ANGLE

**Decision (2026-08-04, Marrs):** Choosing a concept and a template used to create the piece and draft it in the same click. *"The script is way off."* It was, and not because April writes badly: **a concept says what a piece is ABOUT and a template says what SHAPE it takes, and neither says what ARGUMENT it makes or who it is for.** Drafting off the pair is drafting with no editorial intent, so the model has to invent one, and every such draft is generic by construction.

**So the angle is a first-class input, captured before anything is written.** Choosing a template asks one question on its own screen, "What angle do you want to take on this?", and the answer is saved to `piece.angle` before the draft runs.

- **ONE box, not three fields.** The angle, the audience and the rough points arrive in the same breath when a person describes what they want. Splitting them into separate inputs is the form-filling the step exists to remove.
- **It leads the draft message and sits at the TOP of the precedence list** in both prompts, above the concept's own emphasis and above the recipe. It selects and orders what matters; it never licenses a fact the concept does not contain.
- **Copy supplied in the angle is FINAL COPY.** Marrs gave specific hooks and a CTA and the draft wrote its own, because the recipe governs hooks and nothing said otherwise. Lines given in the angle now go in verbatim and beat the recipe, which governs only the shape of what the operator did not write.
- **The angle draft is never lost.** It is mirrored to localStorage per concept+template as it is typed, restored on return, cleared only once a piece exists. Local rather than server-side deliberately: it must survive a failed request and a closed tab, which are exactly the moments a server save would not have happened either. He lost a long angle once; that is one time too many for something that is often the most considered writing in the piece.
- **The angle SEEDS the prezie's narrative** (and scene generation falls back to it), so intent is stated once. On whether the two are the same thing: the **angle** is editorial (which argument, for whom) and the **narrative** is creative (the image that lands it). They arrive together, so they share one input and diverge only if the board later wants a tighter image than the brief had.

**Templates were fighting this, and needed three fixes of their own.**

- **A BUILT-IN BECOMES YOURS THE MOMENT YOU USE IT.** The library lived in a hardcoded array, so the starter templates were permanently unfixable: *"a mess of half-good templates I can't edit"*. Using one now copies it into the stream and the piece references the copy, so refining it afterwards actually affects the next piece.
- **HOOK COUNT IS STRUCTURE, NOT PROSE.** Marrs wrote the hook three times into a recipe and got one hook back, because the prompt is built to produce a single opening and no recipe wording can change the shape of the output. `hook_variants` (clamped 1-6) makes the prompt ask for N genuinely different ways in to the same argument, each with its own on-screen text, over ONE body written once. This is the mechanism behind one-body-three-posts: record every hook in a single session, cut into that many pieces, schedule them days apart.
- **Guidance lives on the templates page**, not in a doc nobody opens: write instructions rather than descriptions, one per line (the fields are injected as separate named sections, so a rule buried mid-paragraph carries less weight), say what NOT to do, and leave specific words to the angle so every piece off a template does not sound the same.

**Consequence if violated:** going back to drafting straight from concept plus template returns the generic first draft, and the fix will look like a prompt problem when it is a missing input. Letting the recipe outrank operator-supplied copy means his own lines get rewritten. Expressing structural asks (how many hooks, how long) as recipe prose means they are silently ignored, which is worse than refusing them.

## D33 — A prezie is authored FIGURES, drawn by conversation. Supersedes D31's fixed scene shape

**Decision (2026-08-05, Marrs):** He described, in plain English, a circle with a question mark, a lever whose falling counterweight flings the work out as output, a building that an "AI" box attaches to and then dissolves inside, and a three-column capability matrix filling in a column at a time. He got four coloured pillars with fact rows, and said April was *"using some kind of formula"*.

**She was not. The vocabulary had one sentence in it.** A scene was `nodes[] of {label, colour, facts[]}` and nothing else, so his prompt could only be translated into that. The fault was mine twice: I built the single shape, and I then proposed a fixed set of five "board types" as the fix. That was also wrong, and his very next request proved it: **the space of visual metaphors has no end, so any fixed vocabulary is permanently one metaphor behind the operator.**

**So generated markup returns, having been removed for good reason.** The deck model let April emit HTML and produced layouts that ran off the display and drifted off-brand. But the diagnosis of that failure was wrong: **it was not the freedom, it was the absence of a loop.** A deck generated 26 states blind and the problem was discovered with a camera pointed at it. Marrs: *"she needs to be able to iterate through the process with me."*

The three things that were missing, and are now the design:

- **ONE FIGURE AT A TIME.** A bad turn costs seconds, not a shoot.
- **A LIVE PREVIEW BESIDE A CHAT.** It is seen before it matters. The preview is the real page at `?figure=N`, not a mock-up.
- **HARD BOUNDS THE ENGINE OWNS.** The substrate, the type floor, the colour tokens, the tap mechanism, the frame. A figure supplies only what is inside its own box.

**REVISION IS THE PRIMARY OPERATION, and the brief ACCUMULATES.** Each turn appends to what the figure has been asked to be. Without that, turn three has no idea what turn one wanted and quietly undoes it, which is precisely what makes an iterative loop feel broken.

**The tap contract is CUMULATIVE.** The engine adds `s1`, then `s1 s2`, and so on, so a rule written for the first tap stays true for the rest of the figure and things stay where the presenter put them. `taps` declares how many the figure needs.

**Sanitising is load-bearing, not ceremony.** Figures serve from the unlisted prezie URL, which is unauthenticated by design (D31), so injected script would run for anyone holding the link. Stripped: script, event handlers, `javascript:`, remote urls, `@import`, `position:fixed`, and any rule targeting `html`, `body` or `:root`. Every selector she writes is then prefixed with that figure's own id, so two figures cannot collide and nothing she writes can reach the engine. Tested against adversarial input, which surfaced a real bug: the `:root` strip needed a loop, because removing one rule deletes the brace the next match anchors on and a single pass left every second one behind.

**Both models coexist.** `prezie.figures` renders as a tapped walkthrough through `renderFigureScene`; `prezie.scene` still renders as the open/close board through `renderScene`. Nothing already built changes behaviour, and `isPrezie` accepts either, because requiring a board would have made every figure prezie read as malformed and vanish from the version list.

**On D31's "no next and no previous":** that still holds WITHIN a figure, where objects persist and transform. Moving between figures is a real transition, because they are genuinely different pictures, and his own description is sequential.

**AMENDED 2026-08-05, same day, from Marrs using it: TALK BEFORE DRAWING, and April must know her own ceiling.**

He could not get a seesaw whose falling counterweight flings a ball: *"she's just not good at physics."* She was not refusing. **Nothing in her instructions said where CSS stops**, so she attempted a simulation, shipped a poor version of it, and he paid in wasted turns. `FIGURE_CAPABILITIES` now names both sides plainly: what CSS is genuinely good at (shapes, transforms, staged reveals, type as graphic, simple loops) and what it cannot do and she must never promise (physics, momentum, arbitrary paths, particles, fluid, 3D, illustration). It also gives her the move to make instead: for a lever, do not animate a flying ball, tilt the beam and let the output ARRIVE at scale, which reads as consequence rather than trajectory. **Naming the ceiling is what lets her say "that will look wrong, here is what reads better" instead of quietly failing.**

**And the loop gains a cheap step in front of the expensive one.** Marrs: *"I would like to explain to her what I'm trying to do, and then she explains to me the figure that she can draw. When I agree on it, she draws it."* So the panel is a conversation: he says what he is trying to get across, she proposes two or three concrete options she can actually build, recommends one, and only when they agree does she draw. **Talking costs a sentence and changes nothing; drawing costs a turn.** The disagreement belongs in the cheap step. The agreed conversation is passed in with the ask, so what was settled while talking is what gets built rather than only the last sentence of it. Drawing stays one click away for when he already knows what he wants.

The thread is deliberately client-side and clears when the figure changes: it is a working discussion about one picture, not a record worth keeping once the picture exists.

**Consequence if violated:** going back to a fixed data shape means the operator's next metaphor cannot be expressed and the tool starts dictating the ideas. Generating a whole prezie in one shot brings back the deck's failure whatever the vocabulary. Dropping the accumulating brief turns iteration into a random walk. Relaxing the sanitiser puts executable content on a public URL.

## D34 — Figures are drawn in SVG, on one fixed canvas. The div box was the wrong primitive

**Decision (2026-08-06, Marrs):** He asked whether we were using the wrong tool at all: *"Maybe CSS is not the right tool. I know that there's a model in Higgs Field that does graphics beautifully, obviously way better than this and way more accurately."* Research in [`pam-console/figure-medium-research.md`](pam-console/figure-medium-research.md); he chose the SVG change out of it, and it shipped the same day.

**The finding: April was missing her asks because she was drawing with boxes.** Asked for a funnel she returned a stack of narrowing bars, and that was read as her ignoring the brief or "using some kind of formula". **It was neither. A stack of narrowing bars is the only funnel a box model has.** `FIGURE_CAPABILITIES` listed "rectangles, circles, ellipses, triangles" and nothing else, so a picture that is fundamentally an OUTLINE could not be expressed. Rendered both primitives side by side on the same two asks to confirm this rather than assert it.

**And `<svg>` was already permitted.** `sanitiseFigureHtml` has never stripped it. The capability was there the whole time and she was simply never told she had it, which makes this the cheapest large change available: a prompt paragraph, not a rewrite. Every existing figure keeps working, because SVG is additive.

**ONE MANDATED CANVAS: `viewBox="0 0 1000 600"` with `preserveAspectRatio="xMidYMid meet"`.** Not left to her, for three reasons. It roughly matches the shape of the screen the prezie is filmed on, so figures fill the frame instead of letterboxing. `meet` guarantees the whole drawing is visible at any frame size, which retires the entire class of failure where a figure ran off the display. And coordinates become thousandths of the width, so the vh-versus-px question disappears inside the drawing and one legibility floor (32 units) covers every figure. Verified at 1400x800 and at iPhone SE 375x667: complete and legible at both.

**What this actually unlocked, tested end to end:** the lever Marrs was told was impossible. The beam tilts, the load drops, and the output travels along a real bezier arc to land clear. `offset-path` gives motion along an authored curve, which is what was missing when a straight tween read as "a sticker sliding rather than an object being thrown". It is still not simulation, and `FIGURE_CAPABILITIES` says so in those words: nothing collides or transfers momentum, so she must not promise a chain of consequences.

**Three traps are written into the prompt because the end-to-end test hit all three:**

1. **A CSS transform on an SVG element turns about the canvas origin, not the shape.** `transform-box:fill-box` plus `transform-origin` on anything rotated or scaled, every time.
2. **SVG text does not wrap and does not shrink.** A label wider than its shape hangs out of it, which is exactly how the first test render failed. `textLength` with `lengthAdjust="spacingAndGlyphs"` when a label must fit a known width; `dominant-baseline="central"` rather than an eyeballed y offset.
3. **The canvas must be checked AFTER each tap, not only at rest.** A tap that moves something can push it off the edge from a perfectly framed resting state, and that only surfaces in performance. With `offset-path` the path end is the travelling object's CENTRE, so it must be inset by its own radius.

**Ids must now be prefixed, where the old rule banned them.** SVG needs ids for gradients, clip paths, masks and motion paths, and every figure renders into the SAME document, so an unprefixed `id="grad"` in two figures makes both wrong. Class-prefixing already existed; ids join it.

**The sanitiser was hardened in the same commit that opened SVG up**, because telling her to draw with it changes what actually arrives. Added: `<foreignObject>`, which hosts arbitrary HTML inside the SVG namespace and is a standard way to smuggle markup past a filter that only knows about shapes; and remote `href`/`xlink:href` on `<image>`, `<use>` and `<a>`, which would make a figure fetch from the network mid-take. Remote targets are neutralised by renaming the attribute rather than deleting it, so a malformed tag cannot be stitched back together. Same-figure references (`href="#xg-path"`, `url(#xg-grad)`) must survive and are tested for explicitly, since gradients and motion paths depend on them. Ten adversarial cases pass, including the two that must NOT be stripped.

**What was rejected, and why it matters that it was checked:** Higgsfield's 25 explainer presets. Queried live rather than recalled. Generative video holds legible type now, so that objection is dead. But the register is consumer explainer (cartoon fruit, pastel storybook, glassmorphic keynote), and more decisively **those presets make the whole video INSTEAD of the presenter.** His format is him on camera operating a screen; handing the video to a generator does not improve that format, it deletes it. Video keeps a real but narrow role for later: render the before and after states in code and use `start_image` plus `end_image` to interpolate only the motion, so brand and copy stay exact. Its cost is that a clip is a re-roll rather than an edit, which breaks the change-one-thing loop the whole stage is built around.

**The rule this generalises to:** code for anything that must be exact, editable or touchable; generated pixels for anything that must be beautiful, textured or physical.

**Consequence if violated:** going back to box-model drawing reinstates the failure that reads as April ignoring instructions, and the diagnosis will be wrong again. Letting her choose the viewBox brings back off-screen figures and breaks the single legibility floor. Dropping id-prefixing makes two figures on one prezie corrupt each other's gradients, which looks like a rendering bug and is not. Relaxing `foreignObject` puts arbitrary markup on an unauthenticated URL.

## D37 — The shoot queue is CROSS-STREAM and grouped by RIG, not by brand

**Decision.** A piece is put in a studio queue with one button on its Script screen or its Prezie stage (both, because a piece with no prezie never visits the Prezie stage, and the Record stage has no screen of its own: it opens the teleprompter), and `/console/studio` is the only thing read in the room: what to shoot, in the order to shoot it. The queue **ignores streams** and **groups by format**, because format is the physical rig. Screen-rig groups come first. Marking a take Recorded advances it to `rough_cut` rather than only removing it from the queue.

**The context that forced it.** Marrs described the whole job in one sentence: *"I can get into the studio, set up the cameras, select one, put the Prezi on the screen, put the text in the teleprompter on the iPad, record it, done, click OK, and go to the next one."* Everything the console already had was organised by brand stream, which is the right shape for editorial work and the wrong shape for a shoot. He had one piece ready in Marrs and others elsewhere, and no view that would put them in front of him together.

**Why cross-stream.** A studio session is one room, not one brand. Grouping by stream would make him tear the lights down and set them up again to shoot the second thing. The stream is still on every row, because it tells him which voice he is speaking in, but it sorts nothing.

**Why grouped by format.** Format determines the rig: `split_screen_short` needs the overhead camera over the 32in touchscreen, a simple vertical needs one camera. Anything with a prezie needs the screen on. So format is the setup, and the groups are the order the room gets rebuilt in. Screen-rig groups sort first so the heaviest setup happens while the room is fresh, and prezie-bearing rows sort first inside a group.

**Recorded advances the stage.** Marrs's call. Leaving a shot piece at `record` would mean footage exists on a card with nothing in the console pointing at it; disappearing it entirely would be worse. `rough_cut` is where the next work actually is.

**Two doors, and the count is on the button.** The Studio is reached from the console home (a card, second after Marketing) and from the marketing dashboard **beside Calendar**, which is where Marrs looked for it: Calendar and Studio are the two things that are about the whole engine rather than one stream, so they belong together. The marketing button carries the queued count, so it says whether a session is worth setting up rather than merely that a studio exists. The count is taken from the pieces that page already loads, so it costs no extra read.

**The QR code is the iPad's way in.** Nothing here can push a URL to another device, and typing a uuid with two cameras waiting is not a workflow, so each row renders a QR of its teleprompter URL, server-side, at request time. It is built from the request's own host so it is correct on localhost, on a preview and on pam.polynize.ai with nothing configured; the `/console/...` path form works on both hosts because the pam rewrite only fires for paths that are not already under `/console`.

**Written in a hurry and worth knowing:** a read is shown in **seconds**, not minutes, because at short-form length every read rounds to "about 1 min" and the number says nothing; over 90 seconds it turns coral, which is a thing to learn before the room is set up rather than after the take. A video format queued with no prezie is flagged on the row for the same reason.

**The QR incident, because the lesson is mine.** I hand-rolled a QR encoder first. It passed every structural test I wrote, including a real spec bug I found and fixed in my own encoder along the way, and jsQR still could not read a single one. Replaced with the `qrcode` package, verified by rasterising the shipped SVG in a real browser and decoding it back to the exact URL. The reason I gave myself for hand-rolling it — that a shoot must not depend on a fetched dependency — was also simply wrong: `qrcode` runs server-side at render time, so nothing is fetched in the studio either way. **A generated code is only tested by a decoder that shares none of your code.**

**Consequence if violated.** Grouping the queue by stream reinstates the rig teardown the grouping exists to prevent. Making Recorded only dequeue loses the footage trail. Encoding a relative path in the QR produces a code that scans and goes nowhere, which fails in the one place there is no time to debug it.

## D38 — The CRM IS the leads table. One row per (owner, email), not a second contacts table

**Decision.** `/console/leads` becomes a CRM: a dashboard of five cards (the same five marketing streams) and one contact list per person. It is built by **extending the existing `leads` table**, not by adding a `crm_contacts` table beside it. Uniqueness moves from `email` to `(owner, email)`.

**Why one table.** A website lead has to appear in Polynize's CRM the moment it arrives. With two tables that means a copy, and a copy can disagree: a contact worked for three weeks in the CRM whose lead row still says nothing has happened. The cost is that one table now serves two readers, the CRM UI and the kit.com sync through `/api/leads`, so `synced_at` keeps its exact prior meaning and stays owned by the sync.

**Why (owner, email) and not email.** The old constraint was globally unique on email, which would have meant that once Marrs added a contact, Shourov could not add the same person to his own CRM. Two people legitimately know the same person.

**A plain constraint, not a functional one.** `unique (owner, email)`, not `unique (owner, lower(email))`. An expression index cannot be named as an upsert target through PostgREST's `on_conflict`, so a functional index would have silently broken every upsert including the website capture path. Callers lowercase instead. This was caught by reasoning about the write path before running it, which is the only reason it is not a production bug.

**Owners reuse the marketing stream ids** (`polynize`, `marrs`, `shourov`, `kristin`, `julian`) rather than declaring a second list of the same five people, so the two dashboards cannot drift. The route rejects any owner that is not a real stream, so a typed url cannot open a sixth invisible CRM that accepts contacts nothing will ever display.

**Team-visible, filtered by owner.** Marrs's call. Everyone can open everyone's CRM; each person has their own list. A genuinely private CRM is the first feature that needs the D28 permissions layer, and D28 says build that with the auth layer rather than piecemeal, so it is not half-built here.

**Sorted by what is due, and NOT a kanban.** The obvious build was columns per stage. Columns hide the date, which is the field that actually tells you to act, and they collapse badly on a phone. So the list sorts dated follow-ups first, soonest first, with undated rows falling back to newest first; stage is a control on each row and the stage filter does the job of looking at one column.

**Two details that would otherwise be silent bugs:** a date from a date input is `YYYY-MM-DD`, which Postgres reads as UTC midnight, and in Sydney that is the next morning, so a follow-up set for today would not read as due until tomorrow. Dates are pinned to midday. And moving a contact out of `new` stamps `last_contacted_at` automatically, because otherwise staying honest needs two deliberate edits and the second is the one people skip.

**The pure model is split from the store** (`lib/crm/model.ts` vs `contact-store.ts`) because the CRM's UI needs the stage list and the types, and importing them from the store would have pulled the Supabase service-role client into the browser bundle.

**Fireflies is designed for and NOT built.** D25 postponed automated Fireflies extraction on client-data security grounds. Marrs's ask here is a different purpose, contact capture rather than content mining, and he said to integrate it when needed, so the columns (`fireflies_transcript_id`, `fireflies_url`) exist and the UI renders a transcript link when they are set, but nothing writes them. **Turning it on is a decision that reverses part of D25 and needs Marrs to say so explicitly.** Note also that the Fireflies MCP is not reachable from a Vercel route, so the real integration is the Fireflies API with a key, not the MCP.

**Consequence if violated.** Adding a separate contacts table reintroduces the copy this decision exists to avoid. Restoring a global unique on email silently blocks two people from sharing a contact. Making the unique index functional breaks every upsert including website lead capture, with no error until a lead is lost.

## How to add to this log

When you make a decision that future-you (or a cold agent) might be tempted to undo, add an entry: the decision, the context that forced it, why, and the consequence of violating it. The bar for inclusion: *would someone seeing this cold reasonably think it's wrong or improvable, when it's actually deliberate?* If yes, it belongs here.

## Change log

| Date | Change |
|---|---|
| 2026-08-12 | THREE FIXES, TWO OF THEM MINE. (1) APRIL WENT SILENT on new concepts. The interview called `complete()` with `maxTokens: 700`, and the production model is a thinking model whose reasoning tokens are MANDATORY, undisableable and counted against max_tokens at roughly 800-950 (established 2026-07-20 when it truncated drafts, which is why the draft ceilings went to 6000/16000). A ceiling below the floor is spent entirely on reasoning and returns an EMPTY STRING, which reads on screen as the agent not answering rather than as an error. The short conversational calls were missed in that earlier fix and my longer interviewer prompt tipped a marginal case over. FIVE calls were under the floor and all are raised: both providers' converse (700), the concept-update chat (700), the media prompt refine (400), the bottleneck probe (200). (2) THE BLUEPRINT LINK 404'd. It was RELATIVE, and on pam.polynize.ai the middleware rewrites any path not already under /console into /console/..., so `/map-your-team/{id}` became `/console/map-your-team/{id}`: a hard 404, verified against production. A blueprint lives on the PUBLIC site, so the url is now absolute to `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` and defaults to polynize.ai. Same rewrite trap as the studio QR codes; second time, hence the test asserting the url can never be relative again. (3) IDEAS GET A COMMIT BUTTON. Autosave meant the note being typed stayed pinned at the top as the current idea forever; now the top box is a permanent blank composer that does NOT autosave to the library, and Commit files it below and clears it. Draft text is held in localStorage so a closed tab does not lose an uncommitted thought, and the note is created WITH its text in one call so a commit cannot half-happen and leave a blank behind. |
| 2026-08-12 | (1) THE LEAD'S BLUEPRINT IS LINKED from both the CRM row and the new-lead email (Marrs: "that's important so I can see the blueprint"). Defined once as `blueprintUrl()` because two callers need it and a link that works in one place and 404s in the other is worse than none. FOUND A REAL BUG DOING IT: the email already had a blueprint link and it pointed at `/blueprints/{id}`, which does not serve these rows. A lead's capability blueprint is a `sales_blueprints` row and is served at `/map-your-team/{id}`, so every one of those links would have 404'd. (2) IDEAS: rough notes that come before a concept, at the bottom of the Core concepts panel ("a place under the core concepts, like an idea section"). Deliberately the least structured thing in the console: a text box and a button, no title and no fields, because the moment a note needs either it stops being faster than the phone's notes app and the notes go back to the phone. One JSON file PER STREAM (`pam/ideas/{stream}.json`) so two people in two streams cannot overwrite each other on a read-merge-write. "Create core concept" carries the note INTO the interview by id rather than through the query string (a note runs to paragraphs), and it seeds the INPUT BOX rather than sending it, so he reads it back and edits before April sees it. Unsent text flushes on unmount: this is a notes app and losing a note is the unforgivable bug. Collapsed by default, since half-formed thinking should not be the loudest thing on the stream page. |
| 2026-08-12 | FIREFLIES FILTERS BY WHOSE MEETINGS THEY ARE (my bug, found by Marrs: "Shourov's lead list is pulling my meetings not his"). The scan fetched recent meetings and offered the SAME set to every CRM, so each list showed whatever the API key could see. It does NOT need a key per person, and the live data proved it: the Polynize Weekly Sync came back with shourov@polynize.com as organiser under Marrs's key, so one key already sees the whole team. The fix is to filter on ATTENDANCE (`STREAM_EMAILS` in streams.ts, addresses taken from real attendee lists), checked against meeting_attendees, participants AND the organiser field, because the live data had meetings where only one of those held the address. Applied in the review route, the ACCEPT path (same filter, or a ticked address could be matched against a meeting that person was never in) and the daily digest. POLYNIZE IS DELIBERATELY ABSENT from the map and no longer offers the pull at all: it is the website-inbound CRM and a meeting's contacts belong to whoever was in the meeting. A stream with no address takes no meeting contacts rather than silently falling back to everyone's. Also: the Polynize logo is off the console cards, replaced by a mint dot at half the avatar circle's diameter (Marrs); a stream with no photo now renders that mark instead of an initial letter, and the leads dashboard renders a circle at all where before a missing avatar meant nothing. 31 Fireflies cases pass, including one asserting the old leak. |
| 2026-08-12 | DAILY FIREFLIES DIGEST (`/api/cron/fireflies-digest`, Vercel cron at 21:50 UTC = ~07:50 Sydney). Marrs asked for the pull to be automatic. It deliberately does NOT auto-add: his Fireflies holds personal meetings and no filter can tell one from a sales call, which is the whole reason the review list exists, so the automation is the REMINDER and not the writing. THE TRAP IT AVOIDS: candidates persist until added or dismissed, so a naive daily email would list the same three people every morning until dealt with, which is a notification muted inside a week. Every address mentioned is recorded (`pam/config/crm-digested.json`) and a digest is only sent when at least one address has NEVER been mentioned, so silence genuinely means nothing new. Addresses are only recorded once a send actually succeeded, otherwise a total send failure would mark people as told and they would never be mentioned again. ONE Fireflies call for all five streams, since the meeting list is identical regardless of whose CRM it is offered to. Goes to the Polynize notify list (the only list that exists) as ONE digest naming each person's CRM, one email per recipient so the list is not leaked. AUTH FAILS CLOSED: the route refuses to run when CRON_SECRET is unset rather than defaulting to open, because the alternative is a public endpoint that reads meeting data and sends mail; compared in constant time. The ignore store was generalised into `email-set-store.ts` since the digest needed the identical shape. 12 auth cases pass, including that an unset secret refuses everything. Needs CRON_SECRET in Vercel. |
| 2026-08-12 | CRM tidy + phone (all Marrs's calls). (1) A dismissed Fireflies candidate is REMEMBERED (`pam/config/crm-ignored.json`), because the scan reads the same recent meetings each time so anyone waved away would reappear on the next press and the list would never shorten: that is how a review list becomes something nobody opens. Ignored addresses join the already-a-contact exclusion set, so the pure filter needs no knowledge of either. Only the email is stored, never a reason and nothing from the meeting. (2) Each contact is now its own contained card in the same leathered language as the rest of the console ("each contact needs to be wrapped and contained in its own little section"). (3) The full-width notify bar became an "Add owner" button top-right opening a modal ("Enter your email if you want to know when someone is contacted"), POLYNIZE ONLY per Marrs, since a personal notify list for your own contacts tells you what you already know; the count lives on the button so the page spends no row on a setting changed twice a year. (4) PHONE: `.main` gutters cut from 28px to 16px console-wide (28 each side costs 15% of an iPhone SE), the identity block stacks (four things on one line at 375px is four truncated things), controls go full-width and thumb-sized, and long addresses wrap via `overflow-wrap: anywhere` plus `min-width: 0` on the flex children (a flex item will not shrink below its content without it). VERIFIED programmatically rather than by eye: headless Chrome enforces a ~500px minimum window, so an apparent right-edge bleed in screenshots was the SHOT being cropped and not the CSS; measuring every element against a hard 375px frame with the phone rules active reported everything fitting. |
| 2026-08-12 | FIREFLIES -> CRM, BY REVIEW (partially reverses D25, with Marrs's explicit go). Probing his real account through the MCP before designing changed the plan twice, and both changes are load-bearing. (1) One "Polynize Weekly Sync" carries twelve internal attendees, so an unfiltered pull would have put eleven colleagues in the CRM from a single meeting: a meeting now yields candidates only from EXTERNAL attendees (polynize.io + polynize.com excluded, confirmed by Marrs) and an all-internal meeting yields nothing. (2) His Fireflies also holds PERSONAL meetings, including a medical appointment in the most recent five, and no filter can reliably tell one from a sales call. That is precisely the risk D25 postponed this over, so NOTHING IS WRITTEN AUTOMATICALLY: the GET only proposes, the meeting TITLE is shown against every candidate because that is what a human reads to judge it, and a tick plus Add is required. The review step costs one click and removes the entire class of problem. Also learned from the live data: `displayName` is null on every attendee, so contacts are created with NO NAME rather than one guessed from the address local part. The accept path re-fetches from Fireflies rather than trusting the browser, so only the ticked EMAILS come from the client. GraphQL errors arrive with HTTP 200, so those are checked separately or a mistyped field would look like an empty account; the API's own message is surfaced because a wrong key and no meetings otherwise look identical. Needs FIREFLIES_API_KEY (added). 24 unit cases cover the filtering against the real data shapes, including that a lookalike domain (mail.polynize.io, notpolynize.io) is not treated as internal. |
| 2026-08-12 | CONTENT QUALITY: diagnosed and fixed at the source (`docs/pam-console/content-quality.md` is the full write-up). Marrs: split-screen scripts off the capability-mapping concept were "really bad. The hooks are bad and the beats aren't great." THREE CAUSES, all found in code. (1) `hook-guidance.ts`, distilled under D26 to avoid "bloating" the prompt, had kept every RULE and discarded the entire seven-pattern library and every worked example: exactly the wrong half, since rules compress and examples do not. The canonical doc predicted the failure by name ("A hook like 'This is why capability mapping matters' is dead on arrival") about the very concept in question. Now carries all seven patterns with their model lines, the paired text/verbal example, three real failed hooks with rewrites, and the eight-point gate. (2) ROOT CAUSE: the concept doc captured the ARGUMENT and none of the AMMUNITION. All seven sections were explanatory, the only concrete slot was optional, and the script prompt forbids inventing specifics, so a thin concept produced a generic hook BY DESIGN. Four sections added (What they believe instead / Concrete specifics / What it costs them / Lines worth keeping) and the interview now refuses to finalise without chasing them. (3) "If the concept holds no such number or proof, do not manufacture one" read as permission to be vague; it now names the no-number patterns and says a vague hook fails identically to an invented one. NEW TERM IN THE FORMULA: an exemplar flag on a piece ("This one is good" + a one-line why) injects worked examples into later drafts for the same stream and format, so the definition of good is what Marrs blesses and works from piece one; the analytics loop plugs into the SAME flag later (one definition, two sources of evidence). Few-shot's real hazard is copying material rather than craft, so the block restates the concept's primacy after the examples and gives a self-test. Brand voice: injection now says to imitate any real SENTENCES in the doc and treat adjectives as description, plus an authoring guide in the editor. DEFERRED ON PURPOSE: the model bake-off, because comparing models on a starved prompt measures which one best disguises missing input; and Sandcastles as an external benchmark, whose MCP server is not connected (no data was substituted from my own priors). |
| 2026-08-12 | GENERATED IMAGES ARE HOSTED IN PAM'S OWN BUCKET, not on the Higgsfield CDN (`lib/marketing/image-host.ts` + the unauthenticated `/console/generated/[stream]/[file]` route, same arrangement as the podcast clip media). Marrs reported two errors all week, "The image was created but could not be saved" and "The overlay was created but could not be saved": two messages, ONE cause, `uploadReferenceImage`. Generation and rendering both worked; only hosting failed. The deeper fault was hosting there at all — `POST /files/generate-upload-url` exists so you can hand a reference photo to a generation call, so using it as permanent storage bet every saved image on an AI vendor's file service keeping its shape, its plan allowing it, and the files persisting. This repo has already been bitten three times by Higgsfield endpoints moving (`/v1/text2image/soul` retired, FLUX Kontext 404, the Soul body shape). Higgsfield is now only a fallback for when no bucket is configured. The error text now NAMES the cause (bucket unconfigured vs the actual Higgsfield status code, read off the axios error's `response.status`/`response.data`, neither of which appears in `err.message`) because the old "try again" hid whether it was auth, a moved endpoint or a size limit, which is exactly why it went a week unfixed. NOTE the cause was inferred from the shared code path, not read from a production log. Soul-ID is unaffected: it takes urls, not bytes. |
| 2026-08-12 | CRM step 2 (extends D38): the NEW-LEAD PING and the ENGAGEMENT IMPORT. Recipients are per-stream CONFIG the console edits (`pam/config/crm-notify.json`, same bucket-or-interim dispatch as the Metricool config), not env vars: adding a recipient should not need a redeploy, and I should not be the one typing a colleague's address into a repo. "Is this lead new?" is asked BEFORE the upsert, because an upsert cannot say afterwards whether it inserted or updated, and a returning visitor re-running the blueprint form would otherwise announce themselves as fresh, which is how a notification becomes noise and then gets muted. The ping is AWAITED, not fired and forgotten: on a serverless function the response can end the invocation and kill an unawaited promise, so a background send is one that sometimes silently does not happen; it never throws and the lead is already committed, so awaiting cannot cost the lead. ONE EMAIL PER RECIPIENT, because a shared To: leaks the notify list to everyone on it. The link origin comes from `PAM_CONSOLE_ORIGIN` and not the request, since this fires on a polynize.ai request and the request host would build a link to the wrong site (falls back to the production console). THE ENGAGEMENT IMPORT IS A BUTTON, NOT A MIGRATION: those records are parsed out of client engagement configs rather than a table, so no SQL could move them and a silent import on page load would be invisible and unreviewable. It upserts on (owner, email) so it is safe to run twice, never blanks a field someone has since filled in, puts the engagement's name in `business` rather than inventing a person called EverStock, and NAMES the ones with no email so he can see which need a hand. Polynize only, since offering it on all five CRMs would invite five copies of the same people. |
| 2026-08-12 | D38: THE LEADS SECTION BECOMES A CRM (`/console/leads`), built by EXTENDING the existing `leads` table rather than adding a contacts table beside it, because a website lead must appear in Polynize's CRM immediately and a copy can disagree with the original. Uniqueness moves from `email` to `(owner, email)` so two people can each hold the same contact; the constraint is PLAIN and not `lower(email)` because an expression index cannot be an `on_conflict` target through PostgREST and would have silently broken every upsert including website capture. Owners reuse the five marketing stream ids so the two dashboards cannot drift. Team-visible filtered by owner (Marrs's call; real privacy needs D28). Sorted by what is DUE, deliberately not a kanban: columns hide the date, which is the field that tells you to act. Dates pinned to midday (a bare YYYY-MM-DD is UTC midnight, which in Sydney is the next morning, so "today" would not read as due). Moving out of `new` auto-stamps `last_contacted_at`. Pure model split from the store so the UI does not import the service-role client. Fireflies columns exist but NOTHING writes them: D25 postponed that on client-data security grounds and switching it on needs Marrs's explicit call. Also this pass: the control centre is down to two equal doors (Marketing, Leads) with Studio moved beside Calendar and Blueprinting delisted-but-alive. |
| 2026-08-12 | D37: THE STUDIO SHOOT QUEUE (`/console/studio`). One "Ready to record" button, on the Script screen and the Prezie stage, puts a piece in a cross-stream queue grouped by FORMAT, because format is the rig and a session is one room rather than one brand; screen-rig groups first, prezie-bearing rows first inside a group. Recorded advances the piece to `rough_cut` (Marrs's call) so shot footage still has something in the console pointing at it. Each row carries a server-rendered QR of its teleprompter URL, absolute and built from the request host, because nothing here can push a URL to an iPad and typing a uuid with two cameras waiting is not a workflow. Reads are shown in SECONDS (every short-form read rounds to "about 1 min"), coral over 90s. THE QR LESSON IS MINE: my hand-rolled encoder passed every structural test I wrote and jsQR could not read one code; replaced with the `qrcode` package and verified by rasterising the shipped SVG in a browser and decoding it back to the exact URL. My stated reason for hand-rolling (a shoot must not depend on a fetched dependency) was wrong too, since it runs server-side at render time. A generated code is only tested by a decoder that shares none of your code. |
| 2026-08-10 | D36: A PREZIE CAN BE IMPORTED. Marrs spent a week failing to get April to draw one figure, then one-shot a whole prezie in a chat in an afternoon and liked it: "April can't one-shot for shit." So the console stops trying to be the author. Paste the HTML on the Prezie stage and it is stored, versioned on the concept, and served at the unlisted studio URL. THE DIAGNOSIS, because it is mine: her prompt had grown to 184 lines and ~10KB, since every failure this week was answered with another rule, so "a large pulsating question mark" now competes with a hundred lines about SVG traps, snap controls and canvas checks. SERVED AS ITSELF, NOT WRAPPED, and that was learned by building the wrapper first and testing it: inside the engine's iframe his taps did nothing, while the same click on the file served directly advanced it 01/12 to 02/12, and the engine stacked a second operator cue strip reading "END" over the better one his file already draws. So the only thing added is the TOUCH SOUNDS, injected as a script, capture-phase and passive so they cannot swallow a tap. Security without the iframe: `Content-Security-Policy: sandbox allow-scripts` gives the top-level document an opaque origin, so a document written by a model cannot call /console/... with his session attached; the samples need CORS precisely because that origin is opaque. Also fixed: the engine returned before playing the sound on any figure that owned the screen with no steps left, which would have made an imported prezie silent for its whole performance. |
| 2026-08-10 | D35: FIGURES RUN IN A SANDBOXED IFRAME, so April can write JAVASCRIPT. Marrs after a week on one board: "she can't do one simple fucking thing", and his next question was the right one: "what's the point of your sanitiser if it's stripping us of capability?" The answer is that it was protecting something real with the wrong instrument. Prezies serve from the console's own origin, and although the session cookie is httpOnly, script on that origin can `fetch('/console/...')` and have the browser attach the session for it, so injected script could act as him against his own console. But `sandbox="allow-scripts"` WITHOUT `allow-same-origin` gives each figure an opaque origin, which removes that structurally: verified in a real browser with a hostile probe figure, which reported `cookie THREW: SecurityError | localStorage THREW: SecurityError | parent.document THREW: SecurityError | origin="null" | same-origin fetch BLOCKED`. So the security is now structural and the script ban is gone, along with the CSS stripping (position:fixed is bounded by the iframe, and html/body are the figure's own document). Dragging, real sliders, physics and canvas are all available; a drag was driven end to end to prove it. Selector scoping and id prefixing are also gone, because separate documents cannot collide. Step state crosses by postMessage with a ready handshake (a bare timeout races the iframe's parse), and the shim forwards raw pointer coordinates so all gesture logic stays in one place. THE COST OF GETTING THIS WRONG: I found the sandbox option days earlier and ranked it third behind two nicer features, then spent the week teaching April to work around a ceiling I could have removed on the first day. "Loads nothing from the network" is no longer enforceable by regex once script is allowed, so it moved into the prompt as a rule rather than pretending to be a guarantee. |
| 2026-08-10 | PODCAST CLIP PIPELINE built at `/console/marketing/podcast`: episode in, ranked clip proposals from the validated method, operator approval, Descript cuts. Unlocked by finding Descript's REST API (`descriptapi.com/v1`, `DESCRIPT_API_TOKEN`), since assembly had only ever been driven through the MCP, which the console cannot reach from Vercel. Checked rather than assumed: Descript job states are queued/running/stopped/cancelled and **`stopped` is not success**, the outcome is in `result.status`, so a stopped job with no status is treated as failed. THE VERTICAL PROBLEM WAS SOLVED UPSTREAM BY MARRS, not in software: he exports from Final Cut already 16:9 with both speakers centred, so a centre crop keeps both and speaker tracking (a manual Descript toggle, not exposed to automation) is not needed. That is the `pre_framed` flag, an operator DECLARATION rather than a detection because a landscape frame carries no signal about whether its subjects were placed for a vertical crop; without it the cautious instruction applies and an unfinishable clip is flagged in the UI rather than looking done. Captions and title are part of the cut, per the house craft already written down. Guardrails: proposing again never destroys a decision, paste is first-class alongside the pull, cuts are polled because a job outlives its request, and a failed poll is not a failed job. |
| 2026-08-06 | D34: FIGURES ARE DRAWN IN SVG, on one mandated canvas (`viewBox="0 0 1000 600"`, `meet`). April was missing asks because she was drawing with div boxes: a stack of narrowing bars is the only funnel a box model has, which had been read as her ignoring the brief. `<svg>` was already permitted by the sanitiser and merely never offered, so this is a prompt paragraph rather than a rewrite, and it is additive. Unlocked the lever Marrs was told was impossible (`offset-path` gives motion along an authored curve), tested end to end at desktop and iPhone SE. Three traps written in because the test hit all three: `transform-box:fill-box` or rotations turn about the canvas origin, SVG text neither wraps nor shrinks, and the canvas must be checked after each tap and not only at rest. Ids must now be prefixed (SVG needs them for gradients and motion paths, and all figures share one document). Sanitiser hardened in the same commit: `<foreignObject>` and remote `href`/`xlink:href`, with same-figure refs explicitly tested to survive. Rejected after checking rather than recalling: Higgsfield's explainer presets make the whole video INSTEAD of the presenter. |
| 2026-08-06 | Figure replies moved from JSON to DELIMITED BLOCKS (`---CSS---` / `---HTML---`) after every build failed with "That came back unusable". Cause was JSON.parse rejecting literal newlines in multi-line CSS, which the snap-control pattern made near-certain overnight: the payload is code and JSON was the format least suited to carrying it. The old JSON shape still parses and now repairs raw control characters inside string values, and a failure logs what actually arrived. |
| 2026-08-06 | PER-TASK MODELS. `complete()` takes a `model` per call, and the touchscreen FIGURE work (both drawing and the discussion about what to draw) reads `FIGURE_MODEL`, falling back to the global so nothing moves by accident. Marrs's read was that April's model "is not a coding model", which is right: figures are CSS and markup while the drafting model is chosen for prose and speed. Checked against OpenRouter rather than assumed: `deepseek/deepseek-v4-pro` is both a stronger coding model and far cheaper than `google/gemini-3.5-flash` (0.43 vs 1.50 per million in, 0.87 vs 9.00 out, same 1M context), so quality and cost point the same way. Worth recording honestly that a model swap fixes none of the five prezie failures so far: four were my vocabulary, prompt precedence and renderer bugs, and the fifth (physics) is a limit of CSS itself. What it should improve is the quality of the CSS. |
| 2026-08-05 | D33 amended: TALK BEFORE DRAWING. The prezie panel becomes a conversation (propose two or three buildable options, agree, then draw), because trial-and-error drawing cost a turn per misunderstanding. And `FIGURE_CAPABILITIES` gives April an honest ceiling after she attempted a physics animation nobody had told her CSS cannot do: it names what she draws well, what she must never promise, and what to offer instead. Also fixed the same day: the figure preview opened fully revealed so it showed the END of a figure, and she was treating the concept as a brief to illustrate rather than reference. |
| 2026-08-05 | D33: a prezie becomes authored FIGURES drawn by conversation, superseding D31's single scene shape and replacing the fixed five-figure vocabulary I proposed the day before (his next request already fell outside it). Generated markup returns with the loop that was missing: one figure at a time, a live preview of the real page, an accumulating brief so revisions do not undo each other, a cumulative s1..sN tap contract, and sanitising plus per-figure selector scoping because these serve from an unauthenticated URL. Both models coexist; nothing already built changes. |
| 2026-08-04 | The SHORT-FORM SCRIPT SHAPE is now Marrs's own, taken verbatim from a script he wrote (`docs/pam-console/short-form-script-shape.md`): N hooks separated by `----`, each with paired ON-SCREEN TEXT and SPOKEN lines, then BEAT 1-4 of spoken prose only, then CTA and CLOSE as separate sections. `HOOK_CRAFT` replaces invented hook examples with craft rules read off his three real hooks (withhold the payload, qualify the audience out loud, carry authority, and make the two lines do different jobs). One of the examples it replaces was a draft he had already rejected as a bad hook, which an agent had pulled from the starter library and recommended back to him: exemplars come from approved work, never from generated drafts. Also: concept and piece renaming separated after a piece rename retitled the in-development card (which was labelled with the first piece's title) and the hub's piece list showed the format label instead of the piece name. |
| 2026-08-04 | D32: the ANGLE becomes a first-class input, asked for on its own screen before any draft runs and saved to `piece.angle`; it leads both prompts' precedence and its supplied lines are used verbatim over the recipe. Angle drafts persist locally so they cannot be lost. Templates: built-ins copy into the stream on use (they were unfixable in code), `hook_variants` makes N-hooks-one-body structural rather than recipe prose, and how-to guidance sits on the templates page. Also: prezies belong to the concept with versions, decks retrofit into prezies, touch SFX from Marrs's samples, format icons on template cards, and the stream/dashboard load was parallelised after it took 3-4s to open a stream. |
| 2026-07-28 | The Screen Prompt stage is renamed the INTERFACE (Marrs: the name kept describing a document, and it is not one). Route `piece/[id]/interface` with the old path redirecting; stage id `treatment_map` and field `piece.treatment` unchanged, display-only as with every prior rename. The move also retired the unreachable deck/slides builders and their four lib modules, since leaving them would have created an `interface/deck/` endpoint; deck PLAYBACK (`/console/deck/[id]`) is kept so existing decks still perform. Audio for shoots settled: DJI lapel mics into the FRONT camera, so front-camera audio is the sync source, which is what the test footage already proved. |
| 2026-07-28 | D31 wired into the console: `scene-store.ts` (data keyed by piece id), `scene-generate.ts` (April returns data, caps enforced in code, colour falls back by position so a set is never monochrome), `/console/scene/[id]` unlisted route, and the Screen Prompt stage rebuilt as a scene editor where edits are direct and cost no LLM call. Engine additions the same day, all from Marrs performing it: a type scale with an absolute floor set by the fact values, no prose on a node (it is what he says, and it was the only variable-length element), a glowing clincher button replacing an invisible swipe, names revealed only once an object has been opened, and an authored line break on the close. The deck engine and its URLs stay live until a piece is shot with a scene. |
| 2026-07-28 | D31 SUPERSEDES D30's slide model: the touchscreen is an INTERFACE, not a deck. `lib/marketing/scene.ts` holds one set of persistent objects plus a view state, moved with FLIP so the same object transforms instead of a new picture replacing it. April supplies data only (nodes / colours / lines / facts); the engine owns all layout and behaviour. Touchable example at `/console/scene/demo`. Console rewiring (generation, editor, storage, per-piece route) still to come; the deck engine stays in place until it lands. |
| 2026-07-27 | D30: the console BUILDS the touchscreen deck in-house (`lib/marketing/deck.ts` engine + `deck-generate.ts` + `deck-store.ts` + the unlisted `/console/deck/[id]` Route Handler), replacing D29's external animator handoff. Oscilloscope house style; cymatics/Lissajous figure per gesture; 4-6 states capped in code after a 26-page first pass; the Screen Prompt plan became SLIDE CARDS (visual + text per card, authoritative over the prose brief). Viewport rule added after a clipped deck: cap against viewport HEIGHT, and measure-and-scale each state after render. |
| 2026-06-05 | Initial decision log: D1–D14 captured from the build history. |
| 2026-06-18 | D15: PAM → marketing engine; mapping/blueprinting to Cognitive Studio; Newkind/reMYnd/Roxbury repos hard-deleted (SOC 2 + off-boarding); EverStock retained. |
| 2026-07-03 | D16: April interviews in-console (SOC 2, minimise Slack); T5 reframed as the intake screen; agent connection is transport-abstract. See `pam-console/agent-socket-contract.md`. |
| 2026-07-07 | D17: small structured data flows through the job contract (console is the writer); large blobs go direct to storage and return a ref. One payload-size rule. |
| 2026-07-07 | D18: tail zone consolidates on Metricool (publish + analytics) behind an abstraction, gated on a schedule test (metricool-cli fallback); Palmier is craft-tier local, never in the console; Descript stays. |
| 2026-07-08 | D19: Output-plan step (platforms + formats + ICP) is the top→middle pivot; production owns one recording + many outputs (shoot once, cut many); treatment is format-specific. See `pam-console/production-model.md`. |
| 2026-07-08 | D20: brand voice is per-stream (not per-owner), editable, April-created, referenced on every content creation. |
| 2026-07-08 | D21: content pillars = style layer (pillar→blueprint→treatment-swaps-by-pillar); per-stream pillar library; referenced on creation. ICP archetypes captured. See `brand-voice-builder-prompt.md`. |
| 2026-07-08 | D22: the authenticity line — human faces/voices are always real captures; generative video only for b-roll/diagrams/disclosed-faceless; provenance flag on every output; voice cloning is patch/dub only. |
| 2026-07-08 | D23: prove the spine with text first (Output-plan → text module → tail → then video Treatment Map); Descript is orchestrated not replaced; `prompt_project_agent` + `explainer_video` are test-first (one real piece, Marrs eyeballs brand fidelity, before reliance). |
| 2026-07-09 | D18 update: the console reaches Metricool via REST (token), not the MCP (headless-safe + sidesteps the providers bug); per-stream → Metricool-brand-id mapping. |
| 2026-07-09 | D24: publishing = brains (Raph proposes/rearranges the plan) + hands (console makes the Metricool REST call, holds the creds); the calendar is console-owned (reads calendar_entries, usable pre-Metricool); Step 1 (per-platform copy + calendar view) built; analytics is per-stream. |
| 2026-07-09 | D24 update: Metricool has no queue API, so "Add to queue" is console-side (per-stream ideal-time slots + timezone, next-slot append); timezone gotcha (Metricool defaults to Madrid, set brand tz to Sydney); Raph deferred (queue likely covers his near-term value). Step 2 fully built. |
| 2026-07-11 | D25: Content Pillar Templates = the creative loop (concept + template → guided completion → queue); template carries the plan (default path; custom remains); per-stream template library + built-in starters; concepts become living master documents (+ Import door); media library per-stream (banked); Fireflies extraction postponed for client-data security (manual Claude-session extraction → Import; method in `concept-extraction.md`). |
| 2026-07-13 | D26: April hook/curiosity-gap skills = canonical docs in repo + condensed injection into console prompts (+ hand to Master Agent Builder); "Content Pillar/Templates" → "Content Series" in UI (code identifiers unchanged); design principles: back button → previous screen, bordered-section visual hierarchy everywhere, cream light theme + dark toggle (--bg stays dark ink). |
| 2026-07-20 | D28: permissions layer (admin vs user) SCOPED but DEFERRED — admin sees all + can move/delete concepts, delete groups, edit global built-in series; users see Polynize + own stream, can copy but not move/delete; editing built-in series needs a global override store; server-side enforcement required. Build with the auth layer, not piecemeal. |
| 2026-07-14 | D27 (amends D2): per-stream media library stores references (Box.com live links / public URLs), not binaries — the console never handles bytes, Box serves the file, Metricool fetches by URL. Media store mirrors the template store (pam/media-library/{stream}/{id}.json); wired into piece production (piece.media → calendar_entries.media → publish resolves to URLs). v1 = paste a Box Direct Link; in-console upload + Box-folder auto-sync banked. Verify Metricool ingests a Box video Direct Link with one real post. |
| 2026-07-20 | Test-feedback fixes (amends D26): UI term "Content Series" → "Content templates" (display-only; reverses the D26 rename); dev-hub "Delete pieces" now deletes ONLY the in-development pieces + their calendar entries, NOT the core concept (the earlier version also called deleteConcept, which destroyed a whole concept — a real data-loss bug; concepts have no versioning so already-deleted ones are unrecoverable); Dashboard link added beside Back everywhere; FLUX Kontext dropped from the Higgsfield model registry (its endpoint 404s — Soul is now the default working model; text-on-image pending a verified FLUX endpoint). |
| 2026-07-20 | Auto-draft on template use (realises D25's "mash the template with the concept"): "Use this template" now generates the first draft in the create/go route — text pieces get a real body, video pieces get a real spoken script (HOOK / BEATs / CTA), both mashing the template recipe + concept + ICP + brand voice via a new shared `lib/marketing/draft.ts` (April's key). Best-effort: a draft failure still creates the piece (manual draft remains). The video Script screen gained a "Draft / Redraft from the concept" button (parity with text; new `script-draft` route). Fixes "it doesn't take the template and mash it with the core concept" and "short-form video generates generic / nothing". |
| 2026-07-21 | D29 assembly PROVEN against real test footage (`docs/pam-console/split-screen-assembly.md`). Rig measured: front = iPhone 17 Pro, overhead = iPhone 13 Pro, both 4K HEVC `rotation=-90` (display 2160x3840 vertical), 25fps, PCM 48kHz stereo. Timecode present but NOT jam-synced, so **audio is the sync source**: cross-correlation found a 383ms offset, corroborated by the 400ms duration difference, no slate needed. The 9:16 capture choice is validated by the maths (a 2160x1920 crop is exactly 9:8, scaling into half a 1080x1920 frame at a clean 2x downsample). **Locked framing: 50/50 split with the overhead crop taking the BOTTOM half of its source, so the display's top edge sits ON the cut line** — Marrs frames it that way deliberately so the content lands just below frame centre and the desk/hands absorb the social UI strip; do NOT centre the display in its half. Full end-to-end render in ~3s. Two measured facts fed back into the Screen Prompt: the whole display is in shot (no crop safe area, my earlier 9:8 derivation was wrong), and the HAND enters from the RIGHT so the payoff belongs left-of-centre and high. |
| 2026-07-21 | D29 amended twice, same day (both from Marrs's live use): (1) the screen plan is a SEPARATE artifact from the script, because the teleprompter renders `piece.script` verbatim and would have had him reading screen directions aloud; script is now spoken-only and the plan got its own PRE-record stage (filling the `treatment_map` slot that already existed between Script and Record). (2) That stage is named the **SCREEN PROMPT** (it prompts the presenter's gestures AND is the animator's build prompt; route `screen-prompt`, delimiter `===SCREEN PROMPT===`, stored field stays `piece.treatment` so drafted pieces are not orphaned), and it became a full **HTML build brief**: global BUILD BRIEF + DESIGN SYSTEM (tactile depth language, real palette, Space Grotesk, decisive motion) + OPERATOR STRIP (the presenter's faint bottom-edge gesture cue, ~14px cream at 6-8% opacity, invisible on camera), then six enforced fields per state (COMPOSITION/TYPE/COLOUR/MATERIAL/MOTION/GESTURE/CUE). Safe area is format-specific (split-screen bottom half = 1080x960 near-square 9:8, centre-weighted; 16:9 full width, PIP corner clear). Capture decision: shoot BOTH angles 9:16 framed-as-final (each half only needs 1080x960, so iPhone 4K vertical oversamples 2x; monitoring + deterministic post beat the marginal sensor gain), framing ~10-15% wide for latitude. Video draft ceiling 16000. |
| 2026-07-21 | D29 (SUPERSEDES D19's "shoot once, cut many"): two purpose-built hero video formats instead of one shared 16:9 recording — **9:16 split-screen** (`split_screen_short`, HERO, built first: front mid-shot top half + bird's-eye of the 32in touchscreen bottom half, 45-75s) and **16:9 screen-record** (`screen_record_long`: full-screen intro then screen recording with a PIP head, overhead when the touch is the point, 4-8 min). The touchscreen IS the visual layer (captured live, not composited per piece) which is what unlocks volume off one setup. Scripts are now TWO-TRACK (`SPOKEN:` + `SCREEN:` per beat) via the new `FormatDef.scriptShape` (format owns the physical shape; template recipes stay editorial); the SCREEN track doubles as the animation-build brief. Simple vertical kept as the lightweight option. Starter templates added: "Concept flip (split-screen short)" + "Walkthrough (screen-record long)". Assembly agreed for the next phase: local studio folder import (Box as backup), automatic audio sync, Descript cut, deterministic ffmpeg composite. |
| 2026-07-21 | Brand-standard text-on-image = DETERMINISTIC render, not the AI model. Lesson from live use: AI image models can't hit an exact font/colour/justification or highlight specific words. So brand text overlays are composited in code via `next/og` (Satori): fixed Space Grotesk 700 (fetched from jsdelivr, cached) + legibility shadow + centre justify; variable text, position (top/centre/bottom), base + highlight colours (defaults #ffffff / #69fccb mint), `*asterisk*`-highlighted words, line-break wrapping. `lib/marketing/text-overlay.tsx` + `media/overlay` route + `MediaTextOverlay` panel; output PNG hosted on the Higgsfield CDN; source dims via the new `image-size` dep. Visually verified in prod (pixel-perfect, CEO in mint). Separate from the AI "Edit an image" panel (kept for restyle). Rule: any precise text-on-media is a deterministic render, never an AI prompt. |
| 2026-07-21 | Text-on-image / image editing added via OpenRouter Nano Banana (Higgsfield has no image editor). Marrs's flow: pick a library image, describe the change (e.g. add words), apply, save back. Model `google/gemini-2.5-flash-image` (GA; 3.x previews 404 on this account) via chat completions with `modalities:['image','text']` + an image_url content part; returns a base64 data URI. Hosting reuses the Higgsfield CDN (`uploadReferenceImage`) so no Vercel Blob is needed. New `lib/marketing/image-edit.ts`, `media/edit` route, `MediaEdit` panel. Confirmed end-to-end in prod (returns a fetchable CloudFront PNG). Provider chosen by Marrs (OpenRouter, reusing the existing key) over Vercel AI Gateway / waiting on Higgsfield. |
| 2026-07-21 | Soul generation RESOLVED + WORKING (corrects the "account-gated" entry below). It was never a plan gate (account has credits + all Soul models). `/v1/text2image/soul` is retired and returns "Unavailable model". From the account's API reference (server platform.higgsfield.ai) the live endpoints are: Soul Standard `POST /higgsfield-ai/soul/standard`, Soul 2 `/higgsfield-ai/soul/v2/standard`, Soul Character `/higgsfield-ai/soul/character`, Popcorn `/higgsfield-ai/popcorn/auto` — all take a FLAT body (top-level prompt/width_and_height/quality/batch_size/custom_reference_id) polled via `/requests/{id}/status` = the v2 `subscribe` default. Fix: point the soul model at `/higgsfield-ai/soul/standard` and use plain `v2.subscribe` (flat); reverted the interim `{params}`/v1 detour. CONFIRMED in prod via the real `generateImages` (base + Soul ID both return completed CloudFront image URLs). Next: add Soul 2 / Character / Reference / Popcorn to the registry as selectable models (one entry each). |
| 2026-07-21 | Soul image generation fix + account-gate finding. `/v1/text2image/soul` needs the body wrapped as `{params}`; it was sent through the v2 `subscribe` client (flat body) → `body.params: Field required`. `generateImages` now routes `/v1/` endpoints through the v1 client's `generate()` (wraps params, JobSet-polls), keeping v2 for non-v1 models. Params validated against the SDK enums (quality 1080p, width_and_height 1152x2048, batch_size 1). REMAINING BLOCKER is external: the API returns "Unavailable model" for the Soul model on Marrs's account (confirmed by a 4-variant probe: base + Soul-ID + v1 + v2-with-params all "Unavailable model"; Soul-ID creation works because it is a different, ungated endpoint). This is a Higgsfield plan/API model-access gate, not a console bug (web-confirmed). The console now shows a clear "enable this model on your Higgsfield account" message. Marrs's action: enable Soul text2image on the Higgsfield plan/key. |
| 2026-07-21 | Template recipe = explicit parts + AI chat on all types + media UX (Marrs). (1) A Content Template's recipe is now three named, promptable fields — **Hook recipe** (an ordered opening formula), **Structure recipe** (the body beats), **CTA recipe** (the close; may say "no CTA") — plus a **Length** field prefilled from an industry-standard per-format default (`FormatDef.defaultLength`). `draft.ts` injects each as its own labelled section so none gets buried; legacy templates with only the old `recipe` still work (it maps to Structure). You bring / You get / Example stay display-only. (2) The on-screen **April chat now appears on the text (post) screen**, not just video: the chat route + ChatPanel were generalized to `{content, kind}` ('script'|'body'), recipe-aware for both; TextOutputScreen gained the two-column workspace + undo + drafting/chat mutual-exclusion. (3) Media "Generate with AI": clearer description, Soul-ID setup restyled as a button, an **Add images** button + guidance (10-20 varied photos) where the library is empty (scrolls to the add form), dead FLUX fallbacks cleaned. FLUX stays out until a real text-on-image endpoint is confirmed (noted in the UI: "more models coming"). |
| 2026-07-20 | Retired the Phase-1 `SEED_PIECES` scaffolding (`lib/marketing/seed.ts`, the hardcoded "Strip the AI out first" short-form piece). It was merged into the stream page + dashboard piece lists but NOT into the develop hub / delete path, so after its real pieces were deleted it lingered as an UNDELETABLE ghost card ("1 piece" on the stream card, "nothing in development" inside, no way to remove it, re-seeded every render). Now that April + the concept bank are live, real content replaces it. Removed the seed + all four usages (dashboard, stream page, piece page, teleprompter); the piece/teleprompter storage-down fallback now degrades to "not found" instead of the stale seed. |
| 2026-07-20 | Recipe master-prompt upgrade (the "recipe" = brand voice + core concept + content template fused into one master prompt, per Marrs). Rewrote `lib/marketing/draft.ts` textSystemPrompt + scriptSystemPrompt from a multi-agent design pass (4 designs → adversarial critique → synthesis): the three inputs are now NAMED with explicit PRECEDENCE (concept = source of truth, recipe = binding structure/house style, brand voice = sound, hard constraints above all), a HOW-TO-FUSE step, hook built from the concept's sharpest fact, brand voice OVERRIDES the default Polynize register (fixes client-stream drafts sounding like Polynize), and the video script now follows the recipe's OWN beats + ending (no forced CTA) with a short-form ON-SCREEN TEXT hook. Validated via a temporary A/B probe against a representative Polynize fixture (Capability Mapping + Contrarian Post): decisive win on the video path (new followed OPEN/TURN/PROVE/LAND; old fell back to generic HOOK/BEAT/CTA + a forced CTA), marginal gain on text. Cost: the editor-style prompt reasons harder (~2000-2300 reasoning tokens), so draft ceilings raised text 4000→6000, video 6000→8000. Probe removed after decision. |
| 2026-07-20 | "Use this template" now forces a FRESH piece + draft each time (`createOutputs` gains `forceNew`, passed by the create/go route). Before, template creation was idempotent per (concept, format, template_ref), so a second use silently reopened the prior piece and the auto-draft skipped it as already-filled — reading as "it just gives me the same post, stuck in a cache". Variations now accumulate in the concept's dev hub (deletable there); the custom Output-plan path stays idempotent. Root cause was reuse, not caching (the piece store does direct Supabase reads, no cache layer). |
| 2026-07-20 | More test-feedback fixes: (1) Undeletable in-development items — the stream page and the develop hub/delete used different grouping predicates, so a card could show with an empty hub and a no-op Delete; unified onto one shared `groupKeyOf` (`lib/marketing/dev-group`). (2) Dashboard button now targets the CURRENT stream's home (Marrs's "dashboard" = the brand page), via a `BackLink` `dashboardHref` prop; non-stream pages keep the all-brands default. (3) Draft truncation ROOT CAUSE (confirmed via a temporary probe against prod): `google/gemini-3.5-flash` is a thinking model whose `reasoning_tokens` (~800-950, and NOT disableable — "Reasoning is mandatory for this endpoint" — nor reliably cappable) count against `max_tokens`; at 1800 a rich recipe prompt spent the budget on reasoning and truncated the visible draft mid-sentence. Fix = generous `max_tokens` (text 4000, video 6000) leaving ample room for reasoning + full output (verified `finish_reason:stop`, complete posts). |

## D39 — A video script is BUILT IN STAGES: agree the hooks, agree the arc, then write. Replaces the one-shot angle box

**The complaint.** Marrs, on the angle screen: *"I get to this page, I'm a little ambiguous on what to do. What angle do I want to take is a little weird."* And on what the concept was failing to do: *"My assumption was that putting a whole bunch of information into a core concept would actually help the AI to choose out of what's good and what's not, but that's not currently happening."*

**The measurement.** The angle he typed for a real piece was ~49 tokens. The fixed instruction April reads around it is ~4,940 tokens: the system frame, the hook pattern library, the house hook rules, the format's output shape, the template recipe, the brand voice, the exemplars. So the operator's brief was about 1% of the input, and from it April produced 100% of the piece in a single call.

That is the actual fault, and it is structural rather than a prompt-quality problem. The first artifact he could review was also the last one produced, so the only way to say "you picked the wrong part of the concept" was to rewrite the angle and regenerate everything. His own diagnosis of the remedy: *"a collaborative process to excavate the good stuff out of me."*

**The decision.** Two cheap checkpoints now sit in front of the expensive one.

1. **Hooks.** April reports what is USABLE in the concept, then proposes six hooks, each carrying the pattern it uses and the concept material it stands on. He ticks, edits, or asks for six more, and anything he supplies himself is used verbatim. Six because he asked for *"five or six to select from"* and said the range is what helps him choose.
2. **The arc.** Given the agreed hooks, April proposes the beats, and for each one states what it argues and what it stands on. That second line is the point of the whole stage: it is the first time her selection from the concept is visible while it is still two lines of text.
3. **The script.** Bound by both. Agreed hooks are reproduced word for word, and the arc outranks the recipe's default beat structure, because it *is* that structure already applied to this concept.

All three stages read the same materials through one `gather()`. Agreement about hooks guarantees nothing if the script stage is looking at a different concept.

**What follows from it:**
- Video no longer auto-drafts on "Use this template", and video skips the angle screen. Landing on a finished script was what made the angle the only decision in the process.
- Text keeps the angle box and keeps auto-drafting. A post is short and cheap to redraft; the staging exists to make an expensive one-shot cheap.
- `hooks`, `outline` and `concept_read` live on the piece, all optional. `isValidPiece` is unchanged, so pieces from before this stay valid and fall back to the one-shot path.
- Skipping the arc is allowed and says so on screen: April will build one herself, which is the old behaviour.

**Deliberately NOT done yet.** The concept document itself is the deeper problem, and Marrs named it: *"we definitely have to refine the process of writing the core concept... it's kind of a big document. I'm not really taking note of what's in that."* It is second, not first, because stage one shows what April can actually use out of a concept. Watching that repeatedly is what will tell us what a good concept must contain. Fixing the concept first would be guessing.

## D40: The Gates. the console's marketing flow is a linear pipeline of five gates over one Narrative

**Adopted 18 August 2026, the same day D39 shipped, and superseding most of it.** Marrs reset the console's direction ("in the attempt to make it the everything platform for my content, it is now the nothing platform") and the redesign was workshopped through a clickable mockup to a build plan he answered five decisions on, verbatim: "1 yes 2 draft-first 3 yes 4 yes 5 yes".

**The shape.** One Narrative moves through five gates, one screen per gate, one mint decision bar per screen, back goes back, and you advance only by deciding:

1. **Idea.** The inbox plus a fresh-idea box. Two decisions: which idea, which lane. The lane (Marrs = opinion in his own voice, Polynize = educational; labelled from streamLabel, renamed from "Marrs Attacks" on 19 August) is the fork that sets channels, voice and CTA, and lane ids deliberately equal stream ids so brand voice and Metricool mappings resolve with no translation.
2. **Article.** The long form, 300 to 450 words, drafted by April the moment the gate is first seen and refined by direct edit or one instruction at a time in a docked chat. **The interview is dead** (decision 1). The article is the source of truth for everything downstream and publishes as-is.
3. **Kit.** Per-platform tick list (LinkedIn, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube: decision 3), counts in "pieces of content", never "placements". Confirming creates MASTER pieces: one per master asset (article, texts, shorts, long, carousel, images), not one per post.
4. **Create.** The masters, video first because it is the long pole. V1 links to the existing editors; the one-card-at-a-time flow is the next build.
5. **Ship.** The kit expands into per-channel calendar entries as DRAFTS at each channel's next open slot (decision 2: draft-first), and one button flips the whole wave live through the existing publishEntry path.

**The cadence layer.** Ultimate state, Marrs's words: "at least two posts a day per channel per platform". Slots are per channel (channel-schedule.ts), two a day, morning and early afternoon, staggered across networks. The times shipped as placeholders pending the Metricool best-times spike. The channel's queue is one queue across all narratives, so two narratives in the same week interleave rather than collide.

**What this supersedes and what it keeps.** The board replaces the stream-cards dashboard as the marketing home (decision 4); the old dashboard moved intact to /console/marketing/streams because Marrs was explicit that the prior design is set aside, not deleted: "we're going to have to repurpose some things from there. The image things, there are some interfaces we're going to have to repurpose." Concepts migrate to Narratives only when picked up, never in bulk (decision 5). D39's staged build survives inside Gate 4's script editor. The template picker as a user-facing choice is gone from this flow; recipes survive as kit internals.

**Deliberately not in v1:** the one-card Create flow, per-channel caption generation (drafts carry the master's own text until then, hand-tuned on the calendar screens that already exist), prezie frame export, the Learn loop (Metricool analytics pull: built during the four-narrative hold, since it needs published data to pull).

---

## D41: Not everything ships through the scheduler. Marrs's own LinkedIn is hand-posted

**Adopted 19 August 2026**, from Marrs's own measurement rather than from any published evidence: *"posting content via platforms like Metricool severely restricts reach... for my personal LinkedIn posts, we have to have a way to alert me with the content. I'll do that on my own via my phone, which just supercharges reach in my experience."* And the boundary he drew: *"I don't actually mind it for the Polynize stream because those ones I usually share with a comment on my own personal page."*

**The decision.** A lane's schedule now carries a **publish mode per channel**, alongside its time slots:

- **`auto`** the wave schedules through Metricool, hands off. Everything except the one case below.
- **`manual`** the console prepares the post and **emails it to him to publish himself**. Default for **marrs + linkedin only**.

Gate 5's button stops claiming to do one thing. It reads "schedule 16, send me 3", the hand-posts are marked in the week grid, and a wave that is entirely hand-posted no longer requires Metricool to be connected at all.

**Why the mode is stamped at PLAN time, not read at ship time.** Changing a lane's setting later must not silently rewrite how an already-planned wave goes out. The stamp lives on the calendar entry (`publish_mode`), and an entry planned before this existed has no stamp and is treated as `auto`, which is how it was already behaving.

**Why the migration is lane-aware.** `normalizeChannelSchedule` takes the lane, so a config file written before modes existed falls back to that lane's default rather than to a global `auto`. Without it, the first read of any existing file would have quietly started pushing his personal LinkedIn through Metricool, which is the exact behaviour the setting exists to prevent. Nine tests cover this, including the legacy-file case in both directions.

**The hand-post brief is a deliverable, not a notification.** One email per wave, not per post. The copy sits in a single selectable block so a long-press on a phone selects the whole post and nothing else; the first comment is separate because the link belongs there rather than in the body; media are plain links he can open and save to the camera roll. Best effort by contract, like the CRM ping: it never throws, because a prepared-but-unannounced post is recoverable from the calendar while an exception would abort the rest of an otherwise fine wave.

**The evidence position, stated honestly.** There is no public study comparing native posting against scheduler posting on LinkedIn, and LinkedIn does not comment on it. His own observation is therefore the best evidence available. That makes it exactly the sort of claim a **setting** should encode rather than an argument should settle, and it is why the mode is configurable per channel instead of hardcoded.

**Follows from this, and still to build:** the LinkedIn document carousel is a hand-post by nature, since we cannot schedule a document through Metricool anyway (see `output-spec.md` section 0), so the PDF has to reach his phone. Marrs: *"we'll find a way to create the PDFs in the console and then present them to me to post organically myself via the mobile app."*

---

## D42: The kit stops counting posts and starts naming them

**Adopted 19 August 2026.** Marrs asked the question v1's kit could not answer: *"Is it a contrarian post? Is it an informative post?"* A count cannot answer it. And the question that follows: *"they need to express the idea in slightly different frames. Maybe four is too much."*

**What changed.** Every Gate 3 tick now names a real END STATE from `output-spec.md`, and the frame reaches April as a different instruction. The screen went from 9 rows to 11 per lane; the default kit went from 19 posts to 15.

| v1 | v2 |
|---|---|
| `4 posts / text, one per beat` | **Contrarian post**, **Hard moment** (marrs) or **Field report** (polynize), **Numbered rules**, one post each |
| `3 images / hook lines on prezie stills` | **Image**, one 4:5 card |
| `Article` | **Article**, plus its cutdown, which IS the contrarian post rather than a fourth item |
| A count pill on every row | A pill only on the three series rows, reading `x3` |
| `Confirm · 19 pieces of content` | `Confirm · 15 posts`, which is literally the number of calendar entries |

### The four rules the file now enforces, each one a thing that was wrong

**1. One output, one piece, for anything with its own words.** This is the load-bearing decision and the one three independent reviews converged on. `piece.master` is used as a unique key per narrative in both the build route and the wave route, so two outputs sharing a master collapse to one piece, last write wins, and the loser keeps its draft while being invisible and never planned. v1 had exactly that shape: four LinkedIn text posts on one piece with one body, so the wave copied the same text onto four calendar entries. **Naming the frames without splitting the pieces would have shipped three identical posts under three different labels**, which is worse than v1's vagueness because it looks like it worked.

So `MasterAsset` gained `texts_hard`, `texts_list` and `texts_field`. The six v1 values are frozen and `texts` now means the **contrarian** frame specifically, which is why an in-flight narrative's existing text piece is adopted (and retitled) rather than orphaned. Every text placement count is therefore 1, which makes Gate 5's existing `missing = count - have` guard exact rather than approximate, and means **no new persisted field was needed on the piece or the entry**.

**2. Every post carries an image**, per Marrs. `visual` is required on every artifact with no optional escape, so an output that forgets one does not compile.

**3. Source strength is part of the data.** Every number is wrapped in `Sourced<T>` with one of `official`, `large_study`, `practitioner`, `ad_data`, `ours`, because a figure with no provenance reads identically whether it came from LinkedIn's API reference or an SEO blog. Where the spec says NO DATA there is **no field**, and `doNotAssert` carries the gap forward as an instruction so the model cannot fill it either. There is deliberately **no target-duration field anywhere**: not one of the three platforms publishes an optimal length, and a field would invite the circulating figures (watch time, or TikTok's five-year-old ad conversion data) to become instructions.

**4. The spec reaches the writer.** `promptFragment(master)` is read by `draft.ts`. Without it the frames are labels: every LinkedIn frame writes format `linkedin_text`, so a contrarian post and a numbered list arrived at the model as the same instruction. Three separate reviews made this the condition on the whole design and they were right.

### Numbers this corrected on the way

**The format registry contradicted the spec, and the registry was the one writing the post.** `linkedin_text.defaultLength` said "150 to 250 words. A quick post is 50 to 100 words" against the spec's sourced 1,300 to 2,500 characters, and that quick-post floor sat **under the ~400 character floor every study agrees on**. `pdf_carousel` said 6 to 10 pages against 7 to 12; `image_carousel` said 5 to 8 slides when the API caps a carousel at 10. All three now match the spec and carry their strength, and for a piece cut from a Narrative the kit's own spec is preferred, because two length authorities in one prompt means the model follows whichever it read last.

**The blanket 4,000 character trim was above every platform's cap.** LinkedIn is 3,000 and Instagram and TikTok are 2,200, so `capCopy` now trims in the platform's own unit. Those units are three different things: characters, UTF-16 code units (TikTok's "runes") and bytes (YouTube's description, where an emoji costs three or four).

**The Gate 5 week grid held a second copy of the master vocabulary** and defaulted anything unknown to "Post", so it would have shown "Post 1 Post 2 Post 3" against a Gate 3 that promised Contrarian, Hard moment and Rules. It reads the catalogue now.

**The first comment was documented and inert.** The Metricool client has always accepted `firstCommentText` and `publishEntry` never sent it; the hand-post brief has always had a place to print it and never had one to read. `CalendarEntry.first_comment` closes both. **Nothing writes it yet** and it is deliberately empty rather than filled with a guessed url: the Gate 4 caption card is what will write it.

### Manual-ness moved onto the output

D41 stores publish mode per lane per channel, and `MANUAL_BY_DEFAULT` only covers marrs. A LinkedIn document cannot be scheduled through Metricool at all, so it is a hand-post **by nature**, not by channel setting: without `handPost` on the output, the polynize lane would have planned it as an auto entry and posted a flat image instead of a swipeable document.

### Which frames, and why not four posts

Three text posts, three different frames, never the same one twice. The count is decided by supply and capacity rather than taste: the Gate 2 article is 300 to 450 words, about **one** text post's worth of material at the spec's character band, so four posts is not a cut, it is a thousand words of invention. Different frames rather than one repeated because the types differ in **which** engagement they produce (the listicle is a comment machine with ordinary ER, the hard moment is the reverse), the ranking behind them is classifier-assigned on somebody else's audience, and three frames on one idea with the idea held constant is the only shape the Learn loop can ever learn from.

Four frames are in the vocabulary and deliberately **off** the screen (win, challenge, recap, explainer). A row he has to decide about every week to serve the rare week he has the material is exactly the overload he named. Explainer is not a default on either lane, because the article and the carousel are already explainers.

**Two risks recorded rather than solved.** The hard moment needs a real cost actually paid, and a 400-word article about an idea usually contains none, so its `doNotAssert` forbids inventing one and it must degrade to the field report. And contrarian fires on both lanes every week, so a narrative with no actual position must say so rather than manufacture a disagreement.

### Flagged, NOT changed: the cadence arithmetic is wrong and it is Marrs's call

The build plan says 56 weekly slots divided by a 19-post kit is "roughly 3 narratives a week". **Slots are not fungible across networks**: a LinkedIn post cannot fill an idle TikTok slot. The honest figure is the per-network floor, which for v1 was **2** (set by Instagram at exactly 14 of 14), and for the typed kit is 1 if LinkedIn respects its own evidence. Section 4 of the output spec measures **4 to 5 LinkedIn posts a week** as the sweet spot; the target of 2 a day is 14. Nothing enforces capacity either: `nextOpenSlots` walks 60 days forward and always finds something, so an oversubscribed channel silently slides posts into future weeks, and past the 60-day walk an entry is created with no `scheduled_at` and is dropped from every wave forever.

Marrs set the 2-a-day target explicitly, so this is flagged rather than changed. The recommendation is LinkedIn at 1 slot a day on weekdays.

### The known migration edge, stated plainly

A narrative that already **planned a wave** under v1 keeps its v1 entries and gains the new typed ones on top, because the wave never deletes a draft the operator did not ask to delete. The plan response returns `extra` so Gate 5 can say so rather than the operator finding out on the grid. A narrative at Gate 3 or Gate 4 migrates cleanly: its ticks resolve, its pieces are adopted and retitled, and only the two new text masters are created.

## D43: A Story is now a Narrative

**Adopted 19 August 2026.** Marrs, reading his own board: *"I'm not sure what you mean by three stories a week. Are you saying three we were calling stories? I thought you were referring to Instagram stories... Maybe stories is a weird word."*

He was right, and the collision is the worst kind: **the word already means something specific on three of the four platforms we publish to.** "Three stories a week" reads as three Instagram Stories, which would be nothing, when it meant three whole weeks of content in flight. A unit name that inverts its own scale to a reader is not a naming quibble.

**His choice: Narrative.** *"That implies story and movement through time."* Which is exactly what the five gates are.

**What it is, stated once so it stops needing restating.** A Narrative is one idea, committed to a lane, walked through Idea, Article, Kit, Create, Ship, and coming out as a week of posts across all four platforms. Currently 15 by default. An **Idea** is a note in the inbox; a Narrative is that note in the pipeline.

**Done all the way, on purpose, because it was cheap exactly once.** The word was only on screen in two places, so screens-only would have been faster. But the code and the conversation would then have drifted permanently, and the storage path would have been the expensive part later. Today there are a handful of these saved. `Story` to `Narrative` throughout: the type, the store file, the routes, the components, and `pam/stories/` to `pam/narratives/`.

**Nothing saved is lost, and here is exactly how.** Reads fall back to the old path (`pam/stories/{id}.json`, and its index), writes only ever go to the new one, so a narrative saved before the rename opens and heals permanently the first time it is saved. Deletes clear **both** paths, because clearing only the new one would let the old file resurrect the narrative on the next read. On pieces, `story_ref` is adopted into `narrative_ref` at read time: without that adoption, a saved piece silently loses its source article and Gate 4 reports "No concept to work from", which is the bug that cost a walkthrough once already. And `/console/marketing/story/...` redirects to the new path, because an open tab pointed at a narrative mid-gate should not 404.

**Two things the rename broke on the way, both caught before shipping, both worth recording because the failure mode is generic.** A blanket search and replace is not safe on a word this common.

1. **It leaked into April's prompts.** "Every fact, name, figure, claim, and story in your draft must come from the concept" became "and narrative", and `Proof or story`, which is a **literal section heading in the concept doc**, became `Proof or narrative` and stopped matching anything. Both reverted. The rule going in: rename identifiers, never prompt prose.
2. **"history" contains "story".** Five places in the decision log became "hinarrative", and one "pastel storybook" became "pastel narrativebook". Fixed. A rename script that matches inside words will find words you were not thinking about.

It also reached well outside the marketing module on the first pass, into the landing page's story-scroll components (`StoryPath`, `StoryMotion`, `StoryLanding`) and the agents prompts, where "story" means a story. All of that was reverted and the rename was rerun scoped to the unit.

**One vocabulary collision accepted rather than solved.** The output spec calls the top family of LinkedIn post types "narrative posts", first-person-with-stakes. So "narrative" now has two senses in the docs. The spec says which is which in its header, and the code uses **frame** for the post-type sense (`contrarian`, `hard_moment`, `listicle`, `field_report`), which keeps them apart where it matters.

## D44: LinkedIn stays at two posts a day, and the slots get a type

**Adopted 19 August 2026, reaffirming a decision after I argued against it.**

D42 flagged that the output spec's only cadence evidence measures **4 to 5 LinkedIn posts a week** as the sweet spot, against the console's target of 2 a day, which is 14. Marrs read the argument and rejected it:

> *"I'm going to keep the LinkedIn to two posts a day: video, then text and images. That's fine, that's what morning and afternoon covered. I've seen plenty of people do that. Four to five, I don't really care about that being a sweet spot. I'm going with the Gary V school of thinking, which is that he posts like 350 pieces of content a day across all platforms, so I'm taking a bit of a maximalist view."*

**That is the decision. 2 a day on LinkedIn stands.** The evidence is recorded in the build plan and the spec and does not need relitigating: it measures one thing (median ER per post at a given weekly volume) and he is optimising a different one (total reach and surface area). Both can be true. The honest position is that we do not have his own numbers yet, which is what the Learn loop is for, and until we do this is a strategy choice rather than a factual dispute.

**But his sentence carried a build requirement I had not noticed.** The two slots are not interchangeable to him: **morning is video, afternoon is text and images.** The slot table cannot express that. `ChannelSlots` is `Record<Network, string[]>`, just times, and `nextOpenSlots` fills them in order, so whichever output the plan reaches first takes 08:30. A narrative would routinely put a text post in the morning slot and a video in the afternoon, which is not what he asked for and he would have found out by looking at the week.

**So slots get a kind**, and the wave matches an output to a slot that will take it. That is the next build.

**Capacity, with the typed kit at 2 a day.** LinkedIn is 4 posts per narrative into 14 slots, so 3 narratives a week fits with room. Instagram is 5 into 14, so 2 fit comfortably and a third overflows by one. So roughly **2 to 3 narratives a week** is what the current shape actually carries, and Instagram binds it, not LinkedIn.

> **Updated 19 August 2026 by D46.** LinkedIn gained a fifth post per narrative (the video, added because this decision's own slot structure had nothing to put in the morning slot), so LinkedIn is now 5 into 14 and matches Instagram exactly. Both floor at 2.8, so the carry is unchanged at **2 to 3 narratives a week** and the two now bind together. Typed slots do **not** reduce it, because the preference is a preference and not a filter: see D46.

**Still true and still unfixed:** nothing enforces capacity. `nextOpenSlots` walks 60 days forward and always finds something, so an oversubscribed channel silently slides posts into future weeks. Past that walk it creates an entry with no `scheduled_at`, which the ship path filters out, so a sustained overrun manufactures posts that can never ship and reports no error. With a maximalist posting strategy this stops being theoretical, so it should be built alongside the typed slots.

---

## D45: The front page is whose content, and every stream has its own board

**Adopted 19 August 2026.** Marrs: *"I've decided that I want this to be for everyone in the team, so we need that first page to come back where it has Polynize, Marrs, Shourov, Kristin and Julian as the opening. When you click on anyone's individual stream, you have the narratives as the board. I think that's better."*

**This reverses part of D40**, which made the flat board the marketing home on the reasoning that the unit of work is a narrative rather than a stream. That reasoning was right and incomplete: a narrative belongs to exactly one person or brand, and with five of them a single flat board mixes five people's work into one list where nobody can find their own. The board did not go away. It moved down a level. **Whose work, then which narrative.**

**The shape now:**

| Screen | What it is |
|---|---|
| `/console/marketing` | Five cards: Polynize, Marrs, Shourov, Kristin, Julian. Counts are **narratives** now, in flight and shipped, not concepts and pieces |
| `/console/marketing/stream/{id}` | That person's board, narratives at their gates, **New narrative** as the primary action. Below it the setup that shapes them |
| `/console/marketing/streams` | Redirects to the front page, since that page IS this screen again |

### The lane is now literally the stream

`NarrativeLane` was `'marrs' | 'polynize'`. It is now `StreamId`, all five. It was already declared that lane ids equal stream ids on purpose so brand voice and Metricool mappings resolve with no translation; this makes that identity literal instead of a coincidence two files have to keep agreeing on. **A narrative saved with either old value is unaffected**, because both are still stream ids.

### The kit keys on the KIND of lane, not on named lanes

This is the part that would have rotted first. The kit had `shown: ['marrs']` on the hard-moment frame and `shown: ['polynize']` on the field report. With five lanes that is either four copies of the same list or a branch per teammate.

So streams gained a **kind**: Polynize is `company`, the four people are `person`. The frames key on that:

- **Hard moment** (a real cost paid, first person) is available to a **person** and not to a brand.
- **Field report** (the pattern across client work, nobody's sign off needed) is the **company's** version of the same job.
- Everything else is both.

Adding a teammate now adds a board and **no branches**. The kit's own invariant check runs over every stream rather than the original two, so a lane whose defaults resolve to nothing is a test failure.

The same rule covers the article's lane register: a stream with no hand-written register falls back to its kind. Writing a paragraph per teammate would be inventing four people's voices for them, and their real voice belongs in their own brand-voice doc, which that block only frames.

**And the measured reason the kinds must stay apart:** a personal profile takes 63% higher engagement than a company page at similar impressions (Metricool 2026). Not a reason to stop posting as the brand, a reason never to judge the two by one number.

### Gate 1 lost a decision

Arriving from a stream means the lane is already answered, so **the lane picker is gone** and the ideas inbox is scoped to that stream: an idea caught for one person is not a candidate for another's narrative. The picker still appears when there is no stream in the url, so the screen cannot become unreachable.

### Core concepts: demoted, not deleted

Marrs: *"Don't worry about the core concept or get rid of that screen."* The narrative's own article replaced the concept as the source of truth at Gate 2 (D40), so concepts are no longer the way in, and the section now sits below the board and the setup instead of leading the page.

**Not deleted, and deliberately so.** There are real imported concepts behind that section, and removing a screen with data behind it on an inference from a sentence that reads two ways is the kind of thing that cannot be undone by clicking. It is one line to remove when he confirms.

### One thing to check with him

He wrote **"Kristen"** and **"Julien"**; the console has **Kristin** and **Julian**, and has since they were added. Kept as they are rather than silently changed, because it is a person's own name on their own board and dictation is the likelier explanation. Worth a yes or no.

## D46: The slots get a type, and a preference is not a filter

**Adopted 19 August 2026**, building what D44 named. Marrs: *"I'm going to keep the LinkedIn to two posts a day: video, text and images. That's fine, that's what morning and afternoon covered."*

He thought it already worked. It did not: the slot table was a list of times filled in order, so whichever post the wave reached first took 08:30. A narrative would routinely put a text post in the morning and the video in the afternoon.

**Now:** LinkedIn's morning slot is the **video** slot and its afternoon slot is the **text and images** slot. The other three networks state no preference, because he said nothing about them.

### The finding that nearly made this inert

**The kit produced no video on LinkedIn at all.** Every LinkedIn output was a text master or the blocked document. So a video-preferring morning slot had nothing it could ever draw from, and the visible result would not have been an error: it would have been a LinkedIn week at half cadence, 7 usable slots instead of 14, with the morning permanently empty. He would have found out by looking at the grid.

Worse, the format registry disagreed with the kit and the registry was the misleading one: `output-plan.ts` already lists `linkedin` among `split_screen_short`'s channels, so anyone checking whether LinkedIn video existed by reading that file concluded yes.

**So the kit gained `li_short`**, one cut on LinkedIn on the existing shorts master, and this is recorded as **a bet, not a gap being filled.** The only LinkedIn video figure in the output spec is negative: median reach down 36% year on year, the steepest fall of any format in the document, and the spec has no LinkedIn video section at all. Adding it is a maximalist bet against the only evidence there is, which is exactly consistent with D44, and it should be judged on his own numbers when the Learn loop can produce them. One cut, not three, because three near-identical videos on the channel whose video reach is falling is volume with no argument behind it.

### Preference, not filter, and the argument is arithmetic

A hard filter would honour his shape exactly and go quiet when nothing matched. Under it, a narrative's 4 LinkedIn stills would queue one per day into the afternoon while every morning sat empty: **the only version of this build that reduces total surface area**, on the channel where he asked for more of it. He is a self-described maximalist. So a slot declares what it is **for**, takes that first, and takes something else rather than going empty.

The invariant that makes it safe is arithmetic rather than argument: **the slots consumed are exactly the ones the untyped fill consumed.** `nextOpenSlots` is not touched, so "never a past time", "never a duplicate" and the 60-day guard are inherited rather than re-earned, and the matcher only decides which post sits in which of those slots. Preference reorders. It never delays and it never drops. A test asserts it per network at five demand sizes.

**The cost, stated because he will see it:** on a quiet week two of his LinkedIn mornings will carry a text post. That is the failure that keeps posting, chosen over the failure that goes quiet.

**So the fallback is visible.** The Gate 5 grid had no time-of-day dimension at all before this, which would have made the whole feature invisible on the only screen he looks at. Every chip now carries its time, a fallback placement is marked `*` in coral with a dashed edge, and a line under the grid says how many and why. A Rules post at 08:30 with no explanation reads as a feature that did not work.

### Five things the adversarial pass caught, all of which would have shipped

1. **A slot preference keyed to `'08:30'` would have evaporated.** The default times are documented as placeholders pending the Metricool best-times spike, so the preference is derived from **time of day** (before or after noon) rather than from a literal time.
2. **Keying by position instead of by time** would have moved the video preference onto any earlier slot added later, because `normalizeSlots` sorts. Keyed by the time string.
3. **Turning `ChannelSlots` into objects** would have broken the tolerant parse in both directions: `normalizeSlots` filters on `typeof s === 'string'`, so a new-shape file read by old code drops every slot and falls back to the placeholder times **silently**. `prefers` is a sibling key instead, exactly as `modes` was in D41. Worst case it is ignored.
4. **`'text and images'` is not `masterKind: 'image'`.** Every LinkedIn still post is a **text** master carrying a mandatory image (D42 rule 2). A slot typed `image` would have matched nothing on LinkedIn and killed the afternoon as well as the morning. The vocabulary is two values, video and still, which is how he said it.
5. **Matching per master rather than per network** puts a video in an afternoon. The video master asks first, sees a three-slot window on Instagram, and is forced into a still slot while the carousel later takes a morning. Demand is now gathered for a whole network before anything is placed.

### Two latent bugs fixed on the way, both of which could double-post

**`have` now means timed OR already live.** Counting every row let a dateless draft block its own replacement forever, because ship filters on `scheduled_at`. Counting only timed rows fixes that and opens something worse: the calendar's PUT route clears `scheduled_at` without touching `status`, so a **scheduled** entry holding a live Metricool id can exist with no date, and treating it as absent creates a second draft that ship then publishes to a real channel. A non-draft row counts as present whatever its date, and only drafts are repaired.

**Orphan drafts are repaired in place, sorted by `created_at`.** `listEntries` has no ORDER BY, so without the sort which orphan gets which slot differed between two runs over identical state, which is a schedule that changes on replan.

Also: an entry is **never saved without a time** any more. It used to be, which manufactured a post that could never ship and never errored; it is now reported on screen and retried next run. The wave lock went from 2 minutes to 6, because `maxDuration` is 300 seconds and a run that outlived its own lock could be joined by a second run computing `have` from a pre-write snapshot.

### Weekends: all seven days, and that is an answer rather than a shrug

He asked. **There is no day-of-week evidence to build on.** Section 4 of the output spec is the only cadence section and not one of its rows is a day; nothing else in the docs or the code carries day-of-week data; the only intended source is the Metricool best-times endpoint, still an unrun spike. A weekday-only default would be a guess wearing the clothes of a rule, and an expensive one: cutting to weekdays drops LinkedIn from 14 slots a week to 10.

The one narrow version that was considered and rejected: default **manual** channels to weekdays, since a Saturday slot on his own LinkedIn is an email asking him to work on a Saturday. It buys nothing, because the hand-post brief is **one email per wave sent at ship time**, not a notification per slot. So a Saturday slot generates no Saturday interruption, and the rule would cost his own lane two slots a week for no benefit.

### Flagged, not built

- **The wave lock is per narrative, not per lane.** Open two narratives on one lane and both read the calendar before either writes, so both can take the same slot. Typed slots neither cause nor worsen it. The precedent for the fix is in the same file: the ship branch already re-reads each entry fresh for exactly this reason.
- **Two timezone sources, and they are different stores.** The wave picks a time using `getChannelSchedule(lane).timezone`; `publishEntry` sends it paired with `getPostingSchedule()[stream].timezone`. Both default to Sydney so it is invisible today. Typed slots make it categorical rather than cosmetic: the post the grid labels the morning video would go out in the afternoon.
- **A calendar entry still has no output identity.** The master `texts_list` serves both the listicle and the explainer, so unticking one and ticking the other leaves `missing` at 0 and the wrong draft stands in. The slot is always right, because the kind comes from the master; the copy can still be wrong.
- **Nothing enforces capacity.** Improved but not solved: the console no longer manufactures unshippable posts at the 60-day cliff, it reports them. It still does not warn that a lane is oversubscribed.

## D47: Gate 4 gets an image editor, and four traps in front of a walkthrough get closed

**Adopted 25 August 2026.** Marrs: *"I wanna fix the gate four editors. That's the blocker for me not going through the entire process... I need the video editor working, the image editor working. Once the images are created, we can work out how to turn the images into a LinkedIn document carousel."*

### The video editor was not the blocker

Worth recording because he believed it was. `ScriptScreen` and everything it calls work for a Gates piece: the article loads through `narrative_ref`, the staged build runs, the split-screen shape comes back, the teleprompter reads it, Ready-to-record queues it. What he was actually hitting is that `piece/[id]/page.tsx` sent **every non-text kind** to `ScriptScreen`, so the carousel and the quote card opened the **video teleprompter** and offered to draft a spoken script for a post nobody says out loud. Fixing the image editor fixes the video complaint.

What the video card still cannot do is **finish**, and that is a deliberate boundary rather than a defect: there is no cut, render or export in the console, and no upload. The mp4 has to reach Box by hand and be registered in the stream library before it can be attached. Nothing on screen says so, which is worth fixing next.

### The image editor: one slide at a time

A carousel is ten self-contained slides and a quote card is one, so they are the same screen with a different count, and **the count comes from the master rather than being asked for**.

The run: April writes the whole plan from the article in one call (a shared visual **world**, the caption, and per slide a headline, a note and a **background** prompt). Then one slide fills the screen, he approves or remakes it, and the next arrives. A progress strip lets him jump back to slide three without losing his place, because the place is a number and not a scroll position.

**The words are composited, not generated.** The background comes from Higgsfield and the type is put on in code with the existing deterministic Space Grotesk overlay. That is not a preference: the only live image model is Soul, described as photoreal images of people, and a model that writes its own words ruins a slide. It is also what makes ten separately generated images read as one set.

**The crop is now exact.** `renderAndHostOverlay` gained a `frame` option, so every slide is composited onto exactly 1080 x 1350 with the source object-fit cover. Instagram crops every slide of a carousel to the **first** slide's dimensions, so a set generated at two sizes is a set with nine wrong crops. Soul offers no 4:5 size at all, so this is the only way the guarantee holds.

**Done means `piece.media` holds the right ids in the right order.** So media is **derived** from the plan on every save (`mediaFromPlan`), never accumulated from clicks: slide order is post order by construction, capped at the API's ten, and only slides with a real file and a real library id count. Unticking and reticking cannot silently move a slide to the end the way a picker can.

Reuse rather than reimplementation: generation is the media library's own Higgsfield call, the words are its overlay, registration is its `add` route, and its Generate and Add-text panels are mounted in a folded "by hand" drawer via a new `base` prop that leaves their existing behaviour untouched.

### Four traps closed, three of which would have ruined the walkthrough quietly

**1. Media was snapshotted at plan time and frozen forever.** This was the worst one. Press "Lay out the week" before the video or the carousel is attached and the entries were created with `media: []`, and nothing could ever fix them: an already-timed entry counts as present so the plan skipped it, the repair branch writes only the date, and the calendar's own PUT has no media field. The post shipped without its images and the only recovery was deleting every entry by hand. **Media now refreshes on every replan**, drafts only, media only, so attaching images later works. `post_copy` is deliberately left alone because it may have been hand-tuned.

**2. The hand-post brief emailed uuids.** `CalendarEntry.media` holds media ids and the email rendered each as a link, so every hand-post brief arrived on his phone as a list of dead uuids with nothing to save. It hit **every marrs-lane LinkedIn post**, which is every post on the one lane the hand-post path exists for. Resolved to real urls now.

**3. Every Gates prezie shared one bucket, and editing one overwrote another narrative's deck.** Prezies are filed by concept slug and a Gates piece has no concept, so all of them fell into `_unfiled`. Opening the Prezie stage on narrative B listed every unfiled prezie ever made and, with none of its own, opened narrative A's, where a hand edit then **saved back onto A's deck**. The studio queue keyed on the same bucket, so it showed a green "Prezie on the screen" pointing at an unrelated deck and suppressed the missing-prezie warning, which is the one thing meant to be checked before a room is set up. A narrative now gets its own bucket.

**4. April was briefed to the wrong artifact for the carousel.** `outputForMaster` returned the first catalogue entry on a master, and the blocked LinkedIn PDF sorts before the Instagram swipe, so the prompt said "7 to 12 pages, under 60 words each" for a set of ten 1080 x 1350 slides, and read the caption cap off a post nobody is making. Blocked outputs are skipped now, and a blocked sibling is left out of the brief entirely.

### Gate 4 now says what is done

Seven visually identical cards sat under a live "Lay out the week" button, so a card with no script and no media looked exactly like a finished one and the most likely thing to do on the screen was also the thing that laid out a wave of empty posts. Each card now reads `✓ ready`, `script written, no video attached`, `no images yet, needs 10`, and the footer counts them.

**Advisory, never a block.** Media refreshes on replan now, so the order is no longer destructive and he does not need protecting from it.

### One bug that only running it could find

The image screen is a client component and imported the slide module, which imported `draft.ts`, which imports `narrative-store`, which imports `node:crypto`. **`tsc` compiles that happily** and the piece page 500s with an `UnhandledSchemeError` from the bundler. The writing half now lives in `slide-propose.ts`, server only, and the client half imports nothing that reaches a store. Same class of hazard as the kit's client-safety rule, and the reason it is worth actually loading a screen rather than trusting a typecheck.

### And a test runner, because the suites kept disappearing

`npm run test:marketing`. 100 assertions over the slide plan, the order guarantee, the card state and all four regressions above. Written into the repo because every suite written outside it has been lost between sessions, which is the wrong property for the week the flow is walked end to end for the first time.

### Still open, and named rather than left to be discovered

- **No upload.** A media asset is a url reference, so a recorded file reaches the console only via Box by hand. Nothing on screen says so.
- **The LinkedIn document carousel** is still blocked and deferred, as he asked. The slides exist now, so turning them into a PDF is the next question.
- **Only one image model is live.** Soul, photoreal people. No diagram, no chart. Every slide background is a photograph, and the fix is a second model in the registry rather than a change to the screen.
- **A calendar entry still has no output identity**, so the slot is always right and the copy can still be wrong.
- **Two competing routes into the calendar**: the wave, and "Prepare posts" on the text screen, which creates dateless entries the wave then has to repair.

## D48: A stream's page is setup, then a funnel of gate lanes

**Adopted 25 August 2026.** Marrs, after seeing the board: *"we need to get rid of the Core Concepts section, the In-Development section, and the Podcasts section from the Content Stream Dashboards. That's the old way of thinking."*

### The three sections are gone from this page, and nothing is deleted

Core concepts, In development and Podcasts no longer appear on a stream's page. Every one of those screens still exists, is reachable by url, and its data is untouched. What changed is that the stream page stops leading with them, and stops paying for **three full store reads** on the way to first byte to render sections nobody uses.

The narrative's article replaced the concept as the source of truth at Gate 2 (D40), so a concept has not been the way in for some time. This is the layout catching up with that.

**Stream setup moved above the narratives**, his call.

### The lanes, which are the actual idea

> *"I like this kind of idea of them being lanes, and each idea is going through gates. If there's a concept that's a gate 3, there are three squares: two of them are filled in, and the third one says Emergent AI. It's all in line, so we can see over time which narratives are further down into the funnel."*

One row per narrative on a shared scale. A gate already passed is a small filled square; the gate it is **at** is the title itself, taking the rest of the row. So the horizontal position of a headline IS its progress, and a column of rows reads as a funnel without a legend:

```
[■][■][■][■][■] The 40 hour week is a rounding error      SHIPPED
[■][■][■][■] Strip the AI out first                  GATE 5 · SHIP
[■][■] Emergent AI                                    GATE 3 · KIT
[■] Why your ops team is the bottleneck            GATE 2 · ARTICLE
Nobody wants another dashboard                       GATE 1 · IDEA
```

**Sorted most advanced first**, his call, with the most recently touched breaking ties.

### This is what absorbs the idea list

> *"This also allows us to integrate the ideas concept in there. If we're writing an idea and it's only a gate one, it goes to the bottom. It's still an idea, and still there."*

A gate 1 narrative has nothing behind it, so it starts hard left at the bottom of the funnel. It is an idea, it is visibly still there, and it needs no separate section. When it moves it climbs on its own.

**The idea capture box survives, moved rather than removed.** It lived inside the Core concepts panel purely by accident of layout, and it is the only place in the console an idea can be caught, so removing that panel would have removed idea capture entirely. It now sits under the lanes.

### Two things worth recording about the build

**No scale along the top, and that was deliberate after trying it.** A five-column header implies the titles line up with it. They do not: a completed gate is a fixed-width square so the rows stay readable at 375px, which means a gate 3 title starts two square-widths in rather than two fifths of the page in. The header promised an alignment the layout does not have, so it went, and each row names its own gate on the right instead.

**The CSS module checker earned its keep.** The first version imported `../lanes.module.css` from a file sitting beside it, so every class resolved to `undefined` and the lanes would have painted unstyled with no error anywhere. `scripts/check-css-modules.mjs` caught it before it shipped. Run it.

## D51: A narrative has a look, and the look is one image

**Adopted 25 August 2026.** Marrs: *"we need a 'Hero Image' as an option, so a main hero image gets created that can then set the style for the rest of the images."*

### What it replaces is a guess

The reference plumbing already existed: the slide render route passes `referenceUrl` to Soul as `image_reference`, so a later slide can be generated in the same world as an earlier one. But the slide screen was **inferring** that reference from whichever slide happened to be approved first. So the look of a ten slide set was decided by approval order, which is not a decision anybody made.

The hero replaces that with one image he chose. And settling the look on **one** generation before spending ten is the whole economy of it.

### It belongs to the NARRATIVE, not to a piece

`Narrative` gained `hero_url`, `hero_media_id` and `hero_prompt`. A piece could not own this: the look has to outlive any one piece and be the same across all of them, since the carousel slides, the quote card and the image on every text post are all the same narrative's images.

**Set together or cleared together.** A url with no library id is a preview nobody blessed, and storing one without the other would make "made but not saved" read as saved to every screen downstream.

### The panel sits above the Gate 4 cards

Because it is upstream of every image made below it. Write a line about the look, make it, and it appears as a preview marked "Not saved yet". Blessing it does the same two steps approving a slide does: register it in the stream library for a real media id, then pin it on the narrative. Until then it is a preview, so **a rejected hero leaves no litter in the library and no half state on the narrative.**

Optional by design and the panel says so: a narrative with no hero behaves exactly as it did, and the slide screen falls back to the old inference.

### Reuse, and the one reuse worth naming

Generation is the same `generateImages` call the media library makes. The crop is `renderAndHostOverlay` with **empty text**, which is the compositor the slide route already proved: `frame` forces exactly 1080 x 1350 with the source object-fit cover. That is what makes the hero usable directly as the image on a text post rather than only as a style reference, which matters because text plus image is now the highest priority flow.

### One bug caught in review

`makeSlide` reads the hero and is a `useCallback`, so without `heroUrl` in its dependency array the closure would keep whatever the hero was at mount, and a hero set during the same session would be ignored until a reload. Added.

### Priorities recorded at the same time

Marrs set both a build order and a flow priority, and they are different axes: build order is hero, then the narrative image pool, then the template picker; flow priority is **text plus image first**, then video, then pdf, with the LinkedIn carousel low.

That reordering is worth stating plainly because it changes what the carousel work is for. The template picker serves priority 3 and low. The hero and the narrative image pool serve **priority 1**, because the image on a text post has no generation path at all today: `TextOutputScreen` offers only the media picker. They are text-plus-image features that happen to have arrived through the carousel.

---

## D52: A narrative's own images come first

**Adopted 25 August 2026.** Marrs: *"on the text options within a narrative stream, the image selection should be a contextual, narrative specific image pool. As the images would be created for this narrative, then we can have a hidden section at the bottom which with a click you can open the media library."*

Right, and it degrades fast: every approved slide and every hero registers into the stream library, so ten slides per carousel per narrative floods it inside a week and a text post's picker becomes a wall of other narratives' slides. That matters more now that text plus image is priority 1.

`MediaAsset` gained an optional `narrative_ref`, stamped at both points where an image is generated **inside** a narrative: the hero panel and slide approval. The picker shows that narrative's pool open and folds everything else behind one "the whole library" toggle with a count.

**An unstamped asset is not wrong.** It belongs to the whole library, which is exactly where a hand-pasted Box link belongs, and where everything registered before today sits.

### The hero is a scene, not a face, and it was right by accident

Marrs: *"the hero image is not always going to be someone's face... for the AI emergent article they want to generate a hero image, which may be 1882, New York... it's less likely people are going to use the Soul image reference."*

The hero route already sends a **prompt only**, with no Soul ID and no reference image, so it is scene generation from the first line, and the panel asks for "a scene, the light, the mood". Nothing to change. Recorded so nobody later "fixes" it into a portrait tool.

What it does sharpen is the second-image-model item: Soul is a photoreal **people** model being asked for 1882 New York, which it will do passably and not well. Nano Banana Pro or GPT Image 2 matters more for the hero than for anything else in the kit, because the hero is the one image the whole narrative inherits from.

## D53: April writes like a person, which mostly means varying the sentence length

**Adopted 25 August 2026.** Marrs: *"a note for April to adjust her writing style to be more human. Not super precise, a bit more human to human, conversational for direct."*

**The diagnosis, because it decides the fix.** The house voice block said "Direct, contrarian, concrete" and "Short sentences. Say the sharp thing plainly", and nothing at all about rhythm. A model optimising for that produces a run of clipped declaratives of near identical length, and **every sentence landing with the same weight is the single most machine-sounding thing prose can do.** It reads as precise rather than as spoken, which is exactly what he described.

So the correction is about **variance, not softening**. The directness stays. What was added is the set of things a person does and a model does not do unprompted:

- One person talking to another, not a document about the subject.
- **Vary the sentence length**, and this is flagged as mattering more than any other line: three sentences of the same length in a row is the sound of a machine.
- Contractions are normal, and so is opening on And, But or So when that is how the thought actually joins.
- **Conversational rather than exact.** Where the natural phrase and the technically precise phrase differ, take the natural one. Precision that costs the rhythm is not worth it.
- Stop hedging every sentence. One qualified claim reads as careful, five in a row reads as a committee.

Applied to the shared voice block in `draft.ts`, so it reaches every text post, every script and every chat rewrite, and separately to the article's own register line, which had its own "told plainly" phrasing.

**Deliberately NOT applied to the slide writer.** A slide headline is a fragment under 14 words, so the sentence-variance rule has nothing to act on, and that prompt is the one that has been truncating: adding two hundred tokens of voice guidance to the call that already fails on payload would trade a real problem for a cosmetic one.

## D54: One name per thing, and the platform mark on the card

**Adopted 25 August 2026.** Marrs: *"the item labelled on Gate 3 has to be similar to the one on Gate 4. For example, the Instagram image on Gate 4 says 'card'. That doesn't make sense. There has to be some continuity between the two."*

### There were three vocabularies and nobody had lined them up

| Master | Gate 3 row | Gate 4 card | Gate 5 chip |
|---|---|---|---|
| images | Image | **Quote card** | **Card** |
| article | Article | The article | Article |
| texts_list | Numbered rules | Numbered rules post | **Rules** |
| shorts | Video / Reels / TikToks / Shorts | Script, 3 hooks one body | Video / Reel / TikTok / Short |

The single image was the worst: three words for one thing. He was right that "card" is not Instagram's word for anything.

**The rule now.** The master's canonical name matches its Gate 3 row exactly, and the detail about how the thing is made moved out of the name into its own line, so `Script, 3 hooks one body` became **Video** with *one script, 3 hooks and one body* underneath. The name says what it is; the line says how it is made.

**The one exception, and it is not an inconsistency.** A video is a **Reel** on Instagram, a **Short** on YouTube and a **TikTok** on TikTok. That is each platform's own vocabulary, and a per-network chip should use it. The test allows a chip to be the singular of a Gate 3 row for exactly that reason, and allows nothing else.

**The card reads its name off the master, not off `piece.title`.** A piece created before today has "Quote card" baked into its stored title, and it would have kept showing that until its kit was re-confirmed. Reading the name off the master makes every card right immediately with no migration. The narrative's headline is already at the top of the screen, so repeating it on every card was noise.

### The platform marks

Marrs: *"the sectioning and branding that is linked to Instagram should be carried across to Gate 4 as well, but not necessarily hierarchical... just make that a little more pronounced so the LinkedIn logo is sitting in there so I can see what's Instagram and what's LinkedIn. You can keep it in whatever order you see fit."*

The text line D49 added ("LinkedIn · Instagram · TikTok · YouTube · 10 posts") became the actual glyphs, using **the same `PlatformIcon` component the calendar already uses**, so there is one glyph set across the console rather than Gate 3's text marks in one place and something else in another.

**Not hierarchical, as he allowed.** The cards stay in production order, video first because it is the long pole, and the marks say where each one goes. Grouping by platform would have buried the ordering that actually matters, which is what to make first.

So the video card carries four logos and a `10`, the carousel and the image carry Instagram, and the article and the three text frames carry LinkedIn. Which also makes the carousel's Instagram-only state visible at a glance, since the LinkedIn document is still blocked.

Locked with 103 new assertions: for every lane and every master, the Gate 4 name must be one of that master's Gate 3 rows, and every chip must be a known name or the singular of one.

## D55: Three looks, and the picker that makes them reachable

**Adopted 26 August 2026.** Marrs: *"What I realised that's missing from here is some templates, some stylistic templates, so the user can choose out of three different styles... Each needs to be on-brand graphically, with minimal text and a small image. One of them can be sort of full-image generation."*

### All three already existed and all three were unreachable

The plan carried a `template`, the generation prompt branched on it, and the compositor had three separate compositions written for it. **No screen ever set it.** So every set ever made fell back to `LEGACY_TEMPLATE`, which is the full frame, and the other two were dead code that typechecked.

It was worse than one missing field. The render call was sending the slide's own fields and **none of the plan's**: no `template`, no `accent`, no `kicker`, and no `total`. So `total` defaulted to 1 and every slide ever rendered came out with no `03 / 10` index and no standing label. The footer the compositor draws had never appeared in production.

### The three

Proved by rendering, not by reading, because Satori fails silently on CSS it does not support: an unsupported property does not throw, it stops drawing, so a template can typecheck and come out with no accent seam and no footer. `npm run proof:slides` writes one PNG per look and all three draw.

| Look | Photo | Generations for ten slides |
|---|---|---|
| **Statement plate** | none | 0 |
| **Split card** | in a window up top | 5 |
| **Full frame** | edge to edge | 10 |

**Split card is the default for a new set.** It is what he described as the requirement, minimal text with a small image; the full frame was the thing he allowed as one of the three, not the thing he asked for. `LEGACY_TEMPLATE` stays `full` and that is not a contradiction: it is what plans written before templates existed were actually drawn as, and reading one back as anything else would redraw finished work.

### The picker draws the layout instead of describing it

"Statement plate", "Split card" and "Full frame" mean nothing until you have seen one, and Marrs has said plainly that he cannot pick from prose: *"I can't imagine this, so just build me a simple clickable version."* So each option carries a 4:5 schematic of its own layout in brand colours at the real slide ratio.

A schematic and not a rendered sample: a sample is one headline at one length, it weighs a megabyte in the repo, and it goes stale the moment the compositor changes. The diagram is drawn from the same facts the compositor uses, so it cannot promise a small photo and deliver a full bleed one.

Each option also says what it costs, because ten generations is a coffee break and that is worth knowing before the choice rather than after.

### Changing the look later is usually free, and says so when it is not

The template decides what April was asked for, so switching is not symmetric, and the asymmetry is real rather than a limitation:

- **Free (`reset`)**: the words and photographs the set already has carry the new look. Every made slide is redrawn from the background it already has, which spends no generations and takes seconds. The fitter resizes type that no longer fits, which is what it is for.
- **Costly (`rewrite`)**: a statement plate has no picture briefs in it at all, so it cannot become a photo look without someone writing the scenes. The option itself says *April writes the set again* in amber, and it asks before it throws the words away.

A full frame needs a brief on **every** slide, since it generates for every slide and a slide with no subject generates something arbitrary. A split needs only one anywhere, because a split slide with no prompt is a deliberate type-only slide and draws as a plate.

One predicate decides both the count on the screen and the loop that does the work, so the button cannot promise "nothing is generated" and then spend ten generations.

### Two controls removed for lying

The **Size** select did nothing: the fitter sizes type to the words it was given, and it cannot honour a fixed size and still fit. **Where the words sit** is honoured by the full frame alone, so it now appears only on a full frame set. A control that does nothing is worse than no control.

29 new assertions, 243 total: the specs and the ids are the same three, the cost maths, the full switch matrix in both directions, and the template surviving a save and reload.

## D56: Four heroes at 4:3, big enough to see, and one of them is the look

**Adopted 26 August 2026.** Marrs, on the D51 hero panel: *"I like on gate four how it starts with the look. I think that's cool. What I would like there is that the prompt generates four images, and then you choose the one you want. Make those 4:3 ratio for the prompt, and I've done this, and it comes up very small. I can't see the image or click on it. I can't interact with that image. It just says 'not saved' at all. I need the images to come up clearly, and if I click, it enlarges them so I can see them properly, and then I select one."*

Three separate complaints, and all three were true: one candidate where he wanted four, the wrong shape, and a 64 by 80 thumbnail with the words "Not saved yet" beside it and nothing to click.

### 4:3 was available the whole time

The obvious read was that Soul could not do 4:3, because `SOUL_SIZES` in this repo lists four sizes and none of them is 4:3, under a comment saying values **must** come from Higgsfield's allow-list. That comment is true and the list is not the allow-list: **the SDK's `SoulSize` has 13 entries**, and two of them are 4:3. `2048x1536` is `SoulSize.LANDSCAPE_2048x1536`.

So this needed no crop, which is the part that matters: a crop would mean the photograph he picked is not quite the photograph he gets. The repo's list is now labelled as the curated subset it is, with 4:3 added, and a test asserts every offered size against the SDK's enum rather than against a list in this repo. **That assertion cannot be made by reading.** A size Soul does not recognise is a 400 minutes into a wait, and it typechecks, lints and deploys on the way there.

### The hero is no longer cropped to the post frame

D51 ran the hero through `renderAndHostOverlay` with empty text, which forced it to exactly 1080 x 1350 so it could be used directly as the image on a post rather than only as a style reference. At 4:3 there is nothing to force, so that step is gone and the hero is stored byte for byte as the model made it.

**What that costs:** the hero is landscape now, so it is not a ready made Instagram 4:5 image. That is the right trade. The priority 1 flow is text plus image on LinkedIn, where 4:3 is the better shape anyway, and it is still a real library asset attachable to anything. What it loses is being pre-cropped for Instagram, which nothing was relying on yet.

### All four are copied into our bucket before they are shown

A Higgsfield url is temporary, and `/media/add` stores a url and nothing else, so anything registered straight off their CDN is a library entry that works today and 404s later.

The alternative shape, hosting only the one he picks, means the client hands the server a url and asks it to go and fetch it, which is a request forgery hole for the sake of not storing three small files. So all four are mirrored on the way back, the candidates he judges are the files that get used, and the three he rejects are unregistered bytes in a bucket that nothing points at.

Byte for byte, through a new `mirrorImageToHost`, not through the compositor: `renderAndHostOverlay` re-encodes to PNG at a frame you give it, which is right when the point is to compose something and wrong when the point is to keep exactly what the model made. It sniffs the type from the bytes when the CDN does not declare one, because refusing a good JPEG over a missing header reads as "the image could not be saved" and sends someone hunting through the generation code.

**Known and separate:** the media library has the same durability problem and this does not fix it. Images generated there are registered as raw Higgsfield urls. Logged as its own item.

### The interaction he described, exactly

Four candidates, two across, each at 4:3 and roughly 290px wide in the gate's 620px column. Clicking one opens it full size, up to 1200px, where the choice is actually made. Nothing about a click is irreversible: the tile enlarges, the viewer commits.

- Each tile also carries its own `Use this one`, so an obvious winner does not need the round trip.
- The hero that is already set gets the same treatment at 260px and opens in the same viewer, because "is this still the right look" is a question you answer by looking at it.
- That viewer shows `Use this one` only for a candidate. The one already set has nothing to choose.
- Escape closes it, the backdrop closes it, and the close button takes focus, matching the console's other modals.
- One across at 375px, because two 4:3 pictures on a phone is two small pictures, which is the complaint again.

"Not saved yet" is gone. It was answering a question nobody asked; what he needed to know was that there were four and that he had to pick one, which is what the line says now.

### The cost, said out loud

Four generations per attempt instead of one. That is the right trade here and only here, because this is the ONE image the whole narrative is generated against, so the minutes spent settling it are paid back across every slide and post that follows. Nothing else in the console generates a batch.

### Amended the same day, on the first real run: the white was generated

Marrs, with four candidates on screen: *"they're all in really weird aspect ratios for some reason. There's this white space, which I don't like. But the images are coming out good."*

Every file came back at the 4:3 that was asked for, so the canvas was never wrong and neither was the layout: each photograph was floated on a white field INSIDE a correct 4:3 frame, at a different size and shape each time, which is why the aspect looked random.

**The prompt asked for it.** The tail said *"leave clear negative space with low detail and low contrast where a caption could sit"*, and his own prompt opened with *"a hyper realistic, historically accurate black and white photo"*. Those two together are a fair description of an archival PRINT: a photograph mounted on white card. So the model drew the mount, correctly.

That instruction was inherited from the slide path, where type is composited over the image and quiet space is the entire point. **A hero carries no type** now that it is not cropped to the post frame, so the rule is inverted here rather than softened, and it names the failure mode explicitly, because "fill the frame" on its own does not rule out a picture of a picture: no border, no margin, no mount, no paper edge, no vignette, *this IS the photograph, not a print or a scan of one sitting on a page*.

The lesson worth keeping: an image prompt inherited from a different composition is a prompt written for a different job. The no-words rule travelled correctly because Soul cannot spell anywhere. The negative-space rule did not.

**Four is not a number that can be tuned either.** Soul's `BatchSize` is exactly `{SINGLE: 1, QUAD: 4}`, so a 2 or a 6 would be another 400 minutes into a wait. Asserted against the SDK enum alongside the size.

## D57: Post copy is plain text, and the asterisks are stripped as well as forbidden

**Adopted 26 August 2026.** Marrs: *"in the written pieces, don't use any star symbols for bolding because that doesn't work here."* His article opened with `**The Future nobody Can See**`, asterisks and all.

### The article was markdown on purpose, and nothing ever rendered it

This was not April going off script. The article prompt said, in as many words: *"SHAPE. Markdown. The first line is a bold title (**like this**)"*. She was doing what she was told.

Nothing in the pipeline renders it. The article sits in a textarea at Gate 2, it is fed to April as source material for every piece cut from it, and it publishes as written. `ReactMarkdown` exists in this codebase and is pointed at exactly one thing, concept docs, which are freeform markdown by design and are never posted. So the article's asterisks were only ever four characters wrapped around a headline on their way into a post box.

He is right about the platforms too. LinkedIn, Instagram, TikTok and YouTube captions have no rich text: what goes in the box is what people read.

**So the article is plain text now.** First line is the bare title, then a blank line, then the article. To give a line weight: put it on its own line, or use caps for a short label.

### Both halves, like the em-dash rule

The instruction stops most of it and a model under a long prompt still reaches for a heading now and then, so the strip is what makes it never reach a post. `stripMarkdownEmphasis` sits beside `stripEmDashes` and runs in the same four places: the draft writer, the script writer, the article writer, and **April's chat edits**. That last one matters: without it the asterisks come straight back the first time he asks her to change a line, and the rule would only hold until he talked to her.

### Where it is deliberately NOT applied

`NO_EM_DASH_INSTRUCTION` is appended to every system prompt in the app from `lib/llm/index.ts`. The markdown rule is not, and must not be, because that would tell the **concept writer** to stop writing markdown, and concept docs are markdown that gets rendered.

The other exclusion is sharper: **a slide headline marks its accent phrase with `*single asterisks*`**, parsed by `parseLine` and set in the brand colour. Stripping that would silently kill every highlight in every carousel. Slide copy comes back through slide-propose's own `cleanField`, so it never touches this, and there is a test that spells out what would break if anyone wired it in.

### The stripper is tested on what must NOT change

The risk in a regex like this is never the marker it misses, it is the character it eats. Emphasis content must start and end with a non-space, and single underscores need word boundaries, which is what keeps all of these intact: `5 * 3 * 2`, `hero_url and hero_media_id`, a `* one / * two` bullet list, `ranked #1`, `#nofilter`, and the lone `(marked *)` this very console prints on a fallback slot.

## D58: A narrative is at one gate. Its pieces are not.

**Adopted 26 August 2026.** Marrs: *"I'm just realising that, on the dashboard, the gate steps that we create are a little more nuanced. After gate four, you could have two or three pieces that are on gate five, but you still have some on gate four. Maybe we need a way to mark how many pieces are just little dots on step five and how many are in step four."*

He is right and the model could not say it. A narrative has one `gate` field, so the D50 bar shows one position, and after Gate 3 a narrative is not one thing any more: it is seven pieces that finish at different times. "Gate 4" on a row could mean one piece left or all seven.

### Dots, under the gate they belong to

One dot per piece, on the same five columns the bar uses, so the answer to "what is left" is read in the column named Create rather than in a summary line somewhere else.

- **Under Create**: a hollow dot for every piece still being made.
- **Under Ship**: a solid mint dot for every piece that has cleared it.

Two shapes rather than two shades, so the columns read differently out of the corner of your eye.

**`ready` is `cardState`'s own definition**, the same function the Gate 4 cards use: the words exist AND the media is attached. So the dots and the cards can never disagree about what is finished, which they would within a week if this had its own rule.

**Capped at ten, then a number.** The default kit makes seven pieces, so dots are right at this scale; past ten nobody counts them and the overflow would also crowd out the word beside them.

**A shipped narrative gets no dots at all.** Every piece is behind Gate 5, the bar already reads solid and the label already says shipped, so sixteen dots would be ink for nothing. It was also the only case that overflowed its column, which is how the redundancy got noticed.

**Nothing before Gate 4 gets them either**, because there are no pieces yet, and a row with an empty count line reads as missing data rather than as an early gate.

### The load that came back

D48 removed three store reads from this page, one of which was every saved piece, on the reasoning that three serial loads were paying for sections that render nothing. This adds one of them back, because the distribution genuinely lives on the pieces.

It is not a reversal of that reasoning: it starts before the existing parallel block so it overlaps rather than adding a round trip, and it degrades on its own. If the piece list fails, the bars render exactly as they did and only the dots go missing.

## D59: What it looks like on the platform, on the right, while you type

**Adopted 26 August 2026.** Marrs: *"What I would like here is a preview of what it would look like on the actual platform. I know that Metricool offers this in the platform. Down the right-hand side, when you change stuff, you can actually see what it's going to look like at the end... as an individual, I'd want to see how that's going to look on the actual platform. It probably should be in the place where I'm editing the piece, so if I'm editing on the left, I can see on the right what it's going to look like."*

And on the layout: *"We could possibly move the context chat down to the bottom left, like most AI platforms now, like Replit... I would say move the context chat to the far left side. You have what you're editing in the middle, and then what it looks like on the right. I think that's a better layout."*

### The Metricool question, answered: no, and it does not matter

He asked whether we could pull it from them. **We cannot.** Their preview is a feature of their own web app, not something the API renders. Their OpenAPI spec at `app.metricool.com/api/swagger.json` has 527 paths covering scheduling, analytics, timelines and best times, and nothing that returns a rendered post. No social API offers this, because a preview is a view and not data.

That is the better answer anyway. Ours can show the fold against figures **this console already holds sources for**, it works before anything is connected to Metricool at all, and it cannot drift out of sync with what we are about to publish, because it renders the same fields the publisher sends.

### The fold is the whole point

A preview that only restates the words is a second textarea. The one fact it carries that nothing else on the screen does is **where the post folds**, because everything past the "see more" is read only by people who already decided to read on.

Every number traces to `docs/pam-console/output-spec.md`, and the sourcing goes with it:

| | Fold | Source |
|---|---|---|
| LinkedIn | 140 characters **or three lines**, whichever comes first | Third-party consensus, no official figure |
| Instagram | 125 characters | Third-party, matching Meta's own ads guide |
| TikTok | **none drawn** | The spec says NO DATA, claims span 55 to 150 |

**The line rule is the part that earns its keep.** A post written in the LinkedIn house style, short lines one idea each, can be 120 characters and still fold after the third line. A character-only preview would have told him the whole thing was visible. The panel says which limit bit: *"120 characters before the fold, cut by the line breaks rather than the length."*

**TikTok gets no fold line, and that is the decision rather than an omission.** An invented figure would be worse than none, because he would write to it.

The stricter of LinkedIn's two figures is the one previewed. A hook that survives the mobile fold survives desktop; the reverse is not true, and the panel says so underneath: *"Desktop shows about 210 characters."*

### Deliberately not a pixel copy

It is the platform's SHAPE: who posted, the copy with its fold, the image at its real aspect, the furniture underneath. Chasing LinkedIn's exact type stack would go stale the next time they reskin and would tell him nothing this does not.

Two things it does get exactly right, because they change the answer:

- **The card is light while the console is dark.** Both feeds are light surfaces, and previewing light-on-dark would misrepresent the one thing the panel is for.
- **Instagram is image led**: the picture comes first and the caption sits under it, because that is the actual difference in how the two feeds read. Behind the fold is faded almost out rather than cut, so the shape of what is being hidden stays visible.

The images resolve **by walking the selected ids**, not by filtering the library, because `publish.ts` resolves ids in array order: filtering would show him a different first image than the one that ships.

### Three columns, and DOM order is not column order

Chat far left, the editor in the middle, the preview on the right, exactly as he described.

The document order is **editor, preview, chat**, which is the right order on a phone and the right tab order anywhere: you write, you check it, then you talk about it. Only the wide layout moves the chat left, with `order`, because the middle column is where your eyes should land when three are open.

Three breakpoints rather than two, because three columns under about 1240px are all too narrow to be worth having:

- **Under 1040**: one column, stacked in document order.
- **1040 to 1239**: two columns, and document order decides which two: the editor and the **preview**, with the chat wrapping underneath. The preview is the panel that has to stay beside what you are typing; a docked conversation reads perfectly well below it.
- **1240 and up**: the three columns.

### Only the text screen, on purpose

Text plus image is his stated priority 1, and it is the flow where the fold decides whether the post works. The slide run already shows the finished slide full size, which IS its preview, and a video piece has nothing to preview until it is cut. `workspace3` is applied on one screen; every other screen keeps the two-column rule untouched.

## D60: A generation goes into our bucket before it is registered anywhere

**Adopted 26 August 2026.** Found while building D56, fixed overnight with his approval.

Images generated in the media library were being registered as **raw Higgsfield urls**. Those expire. Every one of them was a library entry that worked the day it was made and would 404 later, with nothing to say why.

### Why the fix is in `/generate` and not in `/add`

The instinct is to fix it at the door, in `/media/add`, since that is where an asset becomes real. That would be wrong. `/add` storing a url and nothing else is a deliberate decision (D2, amended 2026-07-14): an asset is a **reference** to a file hosted somewhere, which is exactly right for the Box links this console was built to accept.

Auditing all four routes that hand a url to the library found exactly one hole:

| Route | What it returned |
|---|---|
| `/media/edit` | `hostGeneratedImage`'s url, ours |
| `/media/overlay` | `renderAndHostOverlay`'s url, ours |
| `/media/generate` | **a raw vendor url** |
| hand-pasted in the library | a reference, by design |

So one route was out of step with its own two siblings, and fixing it there keeps `/add`'s contract intact and needs no `mirror: true` flag from a client that might forget to send one. A rule enforced by the route that creates the file cannot be forgotten by a caller.

Mirrored through `mirrorImageToHost`, the helper D56 added: byte for byte, in parallel, and a failure loses one image out of a batch rather than the batch. When every copy fails the error says so, because the images do exist and the storing is what broke, and a message that only says generation failed sends the next reader into the model code.

### What this does not do

**Nothing repairs the entries already saved.** Anything registered before today is still a temporary url, and there is no scan or migration. A library image that has stopped loading has to be regenerated, and that is recorded in the todo so nobody goes looking for a bug in the picker.

## D61: A time and its timezone are one fact, so they travel together

**Adopted 26 August 2026.** Todo item 11, fixed overnight with his approval.

`scheduled_at` is **local wall-clock, never UTC**, because that is what Metricool takes: a `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss` paired with a separate IANA zone. A wall-clock time without its zone is not a time.

The console held two zones for one post:

- The wave picked the slot from **the lane's channel schedule**, whose `nextOpenSlots` has always returned `{ dateTime, timezone }` pairs, described in its own comment as "ready for the create call".
- `publishEntry` then read the zone off **the stream's posting schedule**, a different setting stored under a different key for a different feature (Add to queue).

The wave kept `slot.dateTime` and threw `slot.timezone` away. Both settings default to `Australia/Sydney`, which is the only reason this never showed: change one and not the other and the post the grid labels the morning video goes out in the afternoon. Typed slots (D46) made that categorical rather than cosmetic, because a slot now means "the morning video slot" and not just a time.

### The fix is a stamp, not a lookup

`CalendarEntry.timezone` is set when the time is set, and publish sends that. Not "read the right config at ship time", because config read late is the whole class of bug: it also means changing a lane's zone silently reinterprets every wave already planned.

**This is the same discipline `publish_mode` already had**, whose comment says it in as many words: *"Stamped now, not read at ship time: changing the lane's setting later must not silently rewrite how an already-planned wave goes out."* The timezone deserved identical treatment and was simply missed.

Stamped in all three places a time is chosen: the wave on create, the wave on **repair** (the date moved, so the zone that chose it moves with it), and Add to queue, which stamps the posting schedule's zone because that is the one that produced its time.

### The fallback is deliberate and conservative

An entry planned before today has no stamp, and falls back to exactly the config it would have used. Their behaviour is unchanged rather than reinterpreted, which matters because some of them are already live in Metricool.

The resolution rule is one line, so it lives in `posting-schedule.ts` as `timezoneForEntry` rather than inline in the publish path where no test can reach it. A blank stamp counts as absent, since a stored empty string would otherwise be sent to Metricool as the zone.

## D62: Two image providers, because Soul cannot spell

**Adopted 26 August 2026.** Marrs: *"What image model is being used for the images in the gate for the look section? It's very inconsistent, especially in the text. I'd rather use Nano Banana Pro. Actually, that's the model I want to use, but let me know what model is being used at the moment."* Then: *"there is a Nano Banana too, and in OpenRouter, its Model ID is: google/gemini-3.1-flash-image"*

### The answer to his question

**Higgsfield Soul, and it was the only image model in the console.** One entry in `IMAGE_MODELS`. Every image in PAM came from it: the hero, every carousel slide, everything in the media library.

**The text is not inconsistency, it is a hard limit.** Soul is photoreal-people-focused and cannot render legible type. That is so settled in this codebase that every image prompt ends with *"no text, no words, no letters, no numbers, no logos and no signage"*, the entire slide compositor exists to draw brand type in code instead, and the registry has a `goodForText` flag that no model set to true. An 1882 New York street is the worst case for that instruction, because the reference material is covered in signage, so the model paints lettering anyway and it comes out as gibberish.

### Both ids were verified, not remembered

`image-edit.ts` carries a note saying *"The 3.x image previews 404 on this account's OpenRouter access"*, which is exactly the kind of thing that turns into a wrong string shipped. So both ids were checked against OpenRouter's public model list, which needs no key and costs nothing:

| id | Their name for it | Per image out |
|---|---|---|
| `google/gemini-3.1-flash-image` | **Nano Banana 2** (Gemini 3.1 Flash Image) | $0.00006 |
| `google/gemini-3-pro-image` | **Nano Banana Pro** (Gemini 3 Pro Image) | $0.00012 |

His id is real, and their own name for it is Nano Banana 2. The stale note was about the **preview** ids, which are separate strings; these are GA. Both are registered, because his two messages named both and one line of registry each is cheaper than a second conversation.

### The providers are not one shape, and that decided the design

The same public list settled the parameter question, which is the load-bearing fact here: **`supported_parameters` for both Gemini image models is seed, temperature, top_p, max_tokens, reasoning and response_format. Nothing about dimensions.**

| | Higgsfield Soul | OpenRouter Gemini |
|---|---|---|
| Size | exact, from a 13 value allow-list | **no parameter at all** |
| Four candidates | one request, `batch_size: 4` | four requests |
| Aspect guarantee | the API | prompted, then cropped in code |

So a flag on one interface would have been a lie. `image-generate.ts` is the one place that knows there are two, and every caller asks it for a **frame in pixels**: Soul gets the nearest native size by aspect, and an OpenRouter result gets cropped to exactly the frame through the overlay compositor's crop path, which is already in production on the media library's overlay route. That keeps the promise D56 made when it stopped cropping the hero: what he judges on screen is what is stored.

### It always returns urls we host

Which makes D60 structural rather than remembered. A caller **cannot** get an ephemeral vendor url out of `generateHostedImages`, so it cannot register one. The bug fixed this morning is now impossible to reintroduce by adding a fourth caller.

### The key check moved below the model

Both generation routes used to refuse before knowing which model was asked for, so a Gemini model, which needs only an OpenRouter key, would have been turned away for a missing Higgsfield one. Now each provider is checked for its own key, and the error names which key and offers the other model.

### Untested against a live call, deliberately

His overnight guardrail was no credits, and there is no OpenRouter key in this worktree, so **no image has been generated through this path**. Everything structural is asserted (27 new assertions, 335 total) and the request shape is copied from `image-edit.ts`, which is proven against production against the same endpoint with the same `modalities` field. What remains unproven is whether his OpenRouter key has access to these two models, which is one click to find out and returns a named error rather than a silent failure if it does not.

The carousel slide route stays on Soul for now. Its type is composited in code anyway, so text rendering buys it nothing, and switching it would change the look of every slide already made.

## D63: An autosave that checks two of its seven fields is an autosave that lies

**Adopted 26 August 2026.** Todo item 14, fixed overnight with his approval.

The Script screen's save loop built its PUT body from **seven** refs and then re-checked **two** of them. A change to the title, the treatment, the hooks, the arc or the concept-read that landed while a PUT was in flight was never re-sent, and the indicator went to Saved anyway.

### The exact window, reproduced

The debounce hides most of it, which is why this survived: a mid-flight change usually re-arms the 1000ms timer and a second save runs after the first finishes. The hole is the path where **that nudge is swallowed**:

1. An edit starts a PUT.
2. Mid-flight, another field changes and the field is **blurred**, which is what clicking any button does.
3. Blur calls `flush()`, which **clears the debounce timer** and calls `save()`.
4. `save()` sees `inFlight` and returns early. The timer is now gone, so nothing will re-arm it.
5. The loop's own re-check is the only rescue left, and it was looking at the wrong two fields.

Which is exactly the symptom recorded in the todo: agree a hook, press "Propose the arc", and the arc call refuses with the hooks visibly ticked on screen, because the server was never told.

Reproduced against the real component with a stubbed slow PUT, then re-run after the fix:

| | PUTs | The title that landed | Indicator |
|---|---|---|---|
| Before | 1 | the stale one | Saved |
| After | 2 | the mid-flight change | Saved |

### The fix restores a property rather than adding a check

**The image screen never had this bug, for one reason: it holds its whole state in a single ref**, so its one comparison covers everything it can write. That is the property, and it was lost on the Script screen by having seven refs and remembering two.

So the seven are gathered into one `snapshot()`, **the PUT body is built from that snapshot**, and the snapshot is compared whole. A field cannot be sent without also being checked, which means adding an eighth field to this screen cannot reintroduce the bug. That is worth more than the fix itself.

Compared by **value**, not by reference, which is the second half: `hooks`, `media` and `concept_read` are arrays, so a setter that mutated one in place was invisible to the old `!==` while one that rebuilt it with identical contents caused a pointless resend. Stringifying a seven field object twice per save costs nothing measurable.

### The Text screen was audited, not assumed

It captures all three fields it writes and re-checks all three, so a mid-flight change to any of them is caught. Left alone.

## D64: The narrative lock guards the narrative. The calendar needed its own.

**Adopted 26 August 2026.** Todo item 10, fixed overnight with his approval.

The wave route already held a lock, on the **narrative**, and it stays: it was a real fix for a real double-publish, where a dropped browser fetch plus a retry click started a second full run and posted the same drafts twice.

It cannot stop the other collision. Two **different** narratives on the same stream, planned in two tabs inside the same run, each take their own narrative lock and then both do this:

```
read the calendar  ->  work out which slots are free  ->  write entries into them
```

Both reads happen before either write, so both see 07:00 free and both take it. The stream is double-booked with nothing on screen to say so, and the first signal is two posts going out at once, days later.

### The lock belongs on the thing being protected

Which is **the lane's calendar**, not the narrative. So the lane gets its own lock file, taken after the narrative lock and released before it, so the pair nests. Two narratives on different streams cannot collide and are not blocked; two on the same stream take turns, and the second one sees the first one's entries when its turn comes, which is exactly the read it needed.

**Why not optimistic re-checking**, which was the other candidate and what the todo suggested: re-reading the calendar before every save costs a store read per entry, up to sixteen on a default kit, and it still cannot make read-compute-write atomic. It narrows the window for more work. Taking turns closes it.

### Three ways to get a lock wrong, all three tested

- **It expires.** Two minutes, the same window the narrative lock uses, because a crashed run must not wedge a whole stream forever.
- **A run can re-enter its own.** The holder's narrative id is recorded, so a retry inside the window is not refused by the lock it set itself. That would have been a worse bug than the one being fixed.
- **A lock that cannot be read counts as free**, and a malformed one parses to nothing. Guessing "held" produces a stream nobody can ever plan; guessing "free" produces the rare collision this exists to reduce. The narrative lock is still underneath either way.

There is a fourth, and it is in the release rather than the acquire: **release only if it is still ours**, or a run whose lock expired would clear the lock of the run that has since taken over.

### It fails open on purpose

If the lock file cannot be written, the run **goes ahead unlocked** rather than refusing. This is a collision reducer, not a correctness gate, and turning a rare double-booking into a common outage would be the wrong trade. The one thing that must not happen is a narrative that cannot be laid out, so the narrative lock is released before the 409 as well, or a clash would wedge this narrative for two minutes over someone else's run.

## D65: Upload an image, and be straight about why video still cannot

**Adopted 26 August 2026.** Todo item 1, the one it calls *"the last hard gap between Gate 4 and a published post"*, fixed overnight with his approval. Half of it.

A media asset is a url reference only (D2, amended 2026-07-14), so getting a picture into the library meant hosting it somewhere else and pasting the link. There is now an **Upload an image** button above the paste field.

### Presigned, because a phone photo breaks the alternative

Vercel caps a serverless request body at **4.5MB**. A photo off a phone clears that on its own, so a route that accepts the bytes would fail on a fraction of real files with a platform error nobody can act on.

So the browser asks for a short-lived presigned PUT and sends the bytes **straight to the bucket**. The size limit becomes ours to choose rather than the platform's to impose, and no Vercel function ever holds the file.

Three properties worth keeping:

- **The server owns the key.** It is a fresh uuid, because the filename is the whole security surface: nothing a caller sends can walk the path, collide with an existing object, or make the serving route emit something unexpected. The browser's filename is used for the **label** only, which is text.
- **The signature commits to the content type.** The browser must send exactly that header or the bucket rejects the PUT, so a url issued for a png cannot be used to store something else.
- **Registration is last.** The upload lands, and only then does `/add` record it, exactly as a generated image does. An abandoned upload leaves bytes nobody points at, never a library entry pointing at nothing.

### Video is refused, and this is the honest part

Uploading a video would work. **Serving it would not.** `/console/generated/[stream]/[file]` reads the whole object into memory and returns it, which is right for a 2MB picture and wrong for a 500MB video, and the bucket is private so there is no direct url to hand out instead.

**That is the actual reason this console uses Box for video**, and it took building the upload to see it clearly: the gap was never the upload, it was the delivery. So a video is refused at the file picker, before any network call, with the reason and the workaround in the message rather than accepted and later discovered to be unplayable.

**This needs a decision from Marrs, and it is an infrastructure one, not a code one.** Three options, in the order I would pick them:

1. **Vercel Blob.** Public urls by default, built for exactly this, and Metricool could fetch a video directly. New integration on his account.
2. **A public prefix on the existing bucket.** A bucket-policy change so `pam/public/` is world-readable, then hand out the direct url. Cheapest, and it means one of our prefixes is genuinely public.
3. **Stream through the route with Range support.** No infrastructure change, but fragile at Vercel's response limits and the worst of the three for a big file.

Until then Box stays the video path, which is what the hint under the paste field has always said.

### One new dependency

`@aws-sdk/s3-request-presigner`, the official companion to the `@aws-sdk/client-s3` already installed. Checked before and after: **`npm audit` reports the same 6 pre-existing high findings either way**, all in `ws` and unrelated, so this added nothing. Those six are worth a look at some point and were left alone tonight, because an `audit fix` unattended is how a build breaks.

## D66: The analytics panel, at the bottom, honest about being a mock

**Adopted 26 August 2026.** Todo item 7, built overnight with his approval.

Marrs: *"on the main engine page, where it shows everyone, so it's an aggregation of all those stats. And when you go into each of the streams, each one of those streams has an analytics section also. I think it's always going to be the thing at the bottom, because you don't want to look at that first... I'd at least like a mock-up there at the moment, and we're talking about as much data as we can and making it as visual as possible."*

Both places, both at the bottom, below the ideas box on a stream board.

### Every field is one Metricool actually returns

That is the whole discipline of a mock: it is a **promise about what the real panel will show**, so inventing a metric their API cannot give us would be designing a screen we then have to take away. The four tiles and the two table columns map to documented per-post fields: LinkedIn impressions, clicks and engagement; Instagram reach and follows-gained-from-a-post.

What is still unsettled is named on the panel itself: whether `ProviderStatus.id`, which this console stores as `external_ref` when it schedules, is the same id the analytics endpoints take as `postId`. They are documented separately and nowhere stated to be the same, and that single question decides whether any of this can be tied to **our** posts. One authenticated call answers it (todo item 8).

### The form was picked before the colour

Which is the step that usually goes backwards:

- Four headline numbers are a **KPI row of stat tiles**, each with a 12 point sparkline. Not the grouped bar chart four numbers usually get turned into.
- Four networks compared is **horizontal bars**: magnitude against identity.
- Five posts with mixed measures is a **table**, which is also the panel's table view, so nothing is gated behind reading a chart.

**One hue, and identity comes from the logos.** Every mark is mint; the networks are told apart by their own `PlatformIcon` and their name, never by colour. That is stronger than a colour key, and it protects the one colour semantic the brand has: coral is human, amber is hybrid, mint is agent, so spending those four on LinkedIn, Instagram, TikTok and YouTube would quietly remap it.

The house mark specs are applied rather than approximated: a 4px rounded data-end square at the baseline, a 2px line with round caps, an end marker of at least 8px carrying a 2px surface ring, an area wash at 10%, hairline recessive furniture, the value labelled only at a bar's tip, and text always in text tokens with the coloured mark beside it. Proportional figures on the big tile values, tabular only in the table's number columns.

### Two things caught by looking at it rather than by reading it

**The numbers did not add up.** The first version generated the per-network split independently of the headline, so a tile said 95.3K beside four bars summing to 63K. For a mock that is not cosmetic, it is the mock failing at its only job: nobody trusts a panel that cannot add. The split is now a weighted division of the headline with the remainder going to the last bar, the five best posts are a fraction of the same total, and **a test asserts the sum on every scope**.

**The table pushed the page sideways** at 375px. It has a real minimum width, since two of its three columns are mono numerals that cannot wrap, so it scrolls inside its own container and the page does not. Dropping the third column on a phone was the other option and it drops data rather than just the view of it.

### Deterministic, not random

`Math.random` would produce a different number on the server than in the browser, which is a hydration mismatch rather than a cosmetic difference. Seeded off the scope name, so the Marrs panel also looks the same on every reload and a screenshot of it stays true.

The trend **wanders rather than climbs**, because a mock that only goes up teaches the wrong thing about what the panel is for, which is noticing when something stopped working.

## D67: The first real Metricool call is a draft

**Adopted 27 August 2026.** Marrs: *"Let's fire Metricool for real, walk me through it."*

Todo item 2 has been the biggest thing on the board for weeks: the publish button has never been pressed against a real brand, so everything downstream of Gate 5 is theory. Walking him through it turned up the thing missing from the walkthrough.

### Every existing path publishes

Both routes into Metricool, `Add to queue` and `Schedule at set time`, call `publishEntry`, which hardcoded `draft: false` and therefore `autoPublish: true`. So the only way to find out whether the integration works was to put something on a real channel and watch.

**The client has always supported `draft`.** `schedulePost` takes it and sets `autoPublish: !draft`. Nothing ever passed it, so the capability was documented and inert, which is exactly the shape of gap D42 found with `firstCommentText`.

### What a draft proves, which is nearly everything

A draft lands in Metricool's own planner and publishes nowhere. It exercises the token, the brand id, the payload shape, the `providers` objects, the media urls being publicly fetchable, the date, and the timezone pairing. The only thing it does not exercise is Metricool actually pushing to the network.

**It also answers the analytics question for free.** The response id is stored as `external_ref`, and whether that id is the same one the analytics endpoints take as `postId` is the single unknown blocking the whole analytics panel (todo item 8). A draft produces one to compare, at no risk.

### Two decisions inside a small change

**A drafted entry keeps `draft` status.** It gets the `external_ref`, because the id is the point, but it must not read as `scheduled` or the calendar would claim something is live that is not, and every count downstream of it would be wrong.

**The default stays a real publish, and the flag has to be explicit.** A button that says Schedule has always meant schedule. Quietly drafting would be the more dangerous of the two mistakes: he would believe a wave had gone out when nothing had.

The two confirmations are deliberately different sentences. The draft one says where it will and will not appear, because knowing nothing went out is the entire value of it. The publish one names the channel and the date, because that is the part that cannot be taken back.

### One thing the walkthrough turned up about his own lane

On the `marrs` lane **LinkedIn is manual by default** (D41): he posts it by hand because scheduled LinkedIn posts lose reach. So a Metricool test on his own stream is Instagram, TikTok or YouTube, and a LinkedIn entry there will never be the thing that proves the pipe.

## D68: A lane's timezone is where its person actually is

**Adopted 27 August 2026.** Marrs, mid-test: *"Just to note that Kristen's in California, but that's okay. We can fix that."*

He also said the timezones were all working, and they looked like they were. They were not, and finding out why is the more useful half of this.

### The setting he checked had no effect on a wave

Two stores hold a timezone:

| Store | Who edits it | Who reads it |
|---|---|---|
| `pam/config/posting-schedule.json`, per stream | **the Connect Metricool page** | Add to queue |
| `pam/channel-schedule/{lane}.json`, per lane | **nothing. no UI exists** | **the wave** |

**Nothing has ever written a lane's schedule file**, so its timezone was pinned to the Sydney default forever. And D61, yesterday, made the wave's zone the one stamped on the entry and sent to Metricool, precisely so a time and its zone could not drift apart. Correct fix, and it had this consequence: it promoted the timezone with no UI to being the one that ships, which made the only editable timezone decorative for everything a wave creates.

So the field he verified governed Add to queue and nothing else. Kristin's wave would have gone out on Sydney time whatever that page said.

### One field, one effect

The posting schedule's per-stream timezone is now the **fallback** for a lane's schedule, so the one editable field governs the wave too. Three levels, each there for a reason:

1. A value explicitly saved on the lane file. Nothing writes one today, and if a lane UI ever exists a deliberate setting must not be overwritten by a default on every read.
2. **The posting schedule**, which is what the operator can actually edit.
3. The lane's known home, then Sydney.

### Kristin's home is in the code, not in a config file

`LANE_TIMEZONE` names it, the same way `MANUAL_BY_DEFAULT` names his LinkedIn being hand-posted. A fact that is true belongs where it is true, rather than in a file someone has to remember to set before her first wave. Fifteen hours is not a rounding error: her morning video would have gone out in her late afternoon, and the D46 slot types would have said morning while meaning nothing of the kind.

### Still owed

**Two stores for one concept is the actual debt**, and this narrows it rather than paying it. The posting schedule also holds ideal slots that the channel schedule holds per network, so there are two answers to "when does this lane post" as well. Worth collapsing, and not while he is mid-test.

## D69: The analytics spike, as one click

**Adopted 27 August 2026.** Marrs: *"How do we make the analytics numbers real?"*

The honest answer is that the code is the easy part. Four things have to be true about **his Metricool account** before a single real number can appear, and todo item 8 has carried them as "one authenticated call" for weeks. Nobody was going to make that call by hand, so it became a page.

`/console/marketing/metricool/probe`, six GETs, nothing written.

### What it settles

1. **Is the account on Advanced or Custom?** API analytics are documented as those tiers only. A refusal here and the panel is a permanent mock however much we build. The probe can tell a tier refusal from a token problem, because it also calls the brand list that the Connect page already uses: that working while the analytics calls 403 **is** the tier answer.
2. **Does the join work?** Everything rests on the id Metricool returns when we publish, which we already store as `external_ref`, being the same id its analytics take as `postId`. Both are documented and **nowhere does the spec say they are the same**. The probe compares our stored ids against the ids in their feed and prints the verdict.
3. **Do TikTok and Threads return JSON or CSV?** Their paths document a 200 with no schema and a summary that says "Download a CSV". The response's own content type is the entire answer, so it is printed.
4. **Does LinkedIn enumerate everything?** Their limitations page hedges, and it matters more here than elsewhere because his personal LinkedIn is hand-posted by design (D41) and therefore never went through Metricool at all.

### Why a probe instead of just building it

The client, the snapshot store and the nightly pull are about a day. Building all of it and then finding the join does not work would mean throwing away the part that matters, because **the join is what makes a number belong to a piece**. Without it the panel is a vanity dashboard: real numbers, attached to nothing we chose.

### Two things the probe is careful about

**It reports instead of throwing.** `mcFetch` throws on a non-200, which is right for publishing, where a failure must stop, and exactly wrong here, where the status IS the finding. A 403, a 404 and a 200 carrying `text/csv` are three different answers that a thrown error flattens into "something broke".

**It harvests ids shape-agnostically.** We do not yet know whether the feed is `{data: []}`, `{posts: []}` or a bare array, so guessing one and finding nothing would be indistinguishable from the endpoint being empty. It walks the tree, bounded in depth, collecting any `id`, `postId` or `post_id`.

**A number and a string are the same id.** One side of an untested pairing may well be numeric and the other a string; reporting "no overlap" over a type difference is precisely the false negative that would send the build down the fallback path for nothing.

### The chain after it, in order

1. The probe. Ten minutes, and it decides the rest.
2. **Our own snapshot store**, which is not optional and is the piece most likely to be skipped. Metricool scopes data to a brand, holds no notion of our narratives or pieces, and states no retention window. Without periodic pulls stored our side there is no history, no trend, and no answer to "did the Emergent AI carousel outperform".
3. A nightly pull, with backoff and a cache, because no rate limits are published anywhere and the engine page aggregates every stream.
4. **The panel last.** Swapped tile by tile, showing "no data yet" where there is none rather than a zero, because a zero is a claim.

## D70: An error that says "try again" when a retry cannot help

**Adopted 27 August 2026.** Marrs: *"April is not working getting error: April is unavailable right now. Try again in a moment."* Then: *"I got it creating a new idea."*

### The message was the bug before the outage was

`April is unavailable right now. Try again in a moment.` was thrown by **eleven routes** and meant eleven different things. The provider layer already raises good errors, `OpenRouter 429: ...`, `OpenRouter returned no content`, `OpenRouter stream timed out after 240000ms`, and every one was caught and flattened into that sentence.

**And for most of the causes the advice is wrong.** A revoked key, an empty account, and a model the key cannot use are all permanent until somebody changes something. "Try again in a moment" sends the operator in a circle while the real fix is one line in Vercel.

### What diagnosing it actually took, which is the argument for the change

Reading OpenRouter's public model list to confirm the configured model still exists. Reading the prompt to confirm a template literal still interpolated. Running the markdown stripper I shipped last night against a real article to rule it out (0ms, no throw, arithmetic and `snake_case` intact). Attempting Vercel's runtime logs, which return 403 for this team, and the CLI, which is not on PATH.

**None of that would have been necessary if the screen had said "OpenRouter refused the key".**

### What it says now

| Cause | What it says | Retry? |
|---|---|---|
| Key not set | names both env vars | no, it is a deploy |
| Empty response | **blames the token ceiling**, not the provider | no, raise max_tokens |
| 401 / 403 | refused the key, and says no retry will fix it | no |
| 402 | out of credit | no |
| 404 | the model, not the key | no |
| 429 | rate limited | **yes, genuinely** |
| 5xx | their side | yes |
| 400 / 422 | a payload problem, with the detail | no |

The empty-response case earns its own wording because it looks like an outage and is not: the production model reasons before it answers and those tokens count against `max_tokens`, so a ceiling below the reasoning floor is spent entirely on thinking and returns an empty string. **That has bitten this codebase twice.** A generic "try again" is how it bit it the second time.

### It never echoes a secret

The provider errors carry a response body. OpenRouter's do not include the key, but a redaction pass over bearer tokens, `sk-` keys and long hex blobs costs nothing, and the alternative is trusting that forever. Tested, including that the sentence still says something useful after redacting.

### What this does NOT do

**It does not fix the outage.** The cause is still unknown, on the provider side, and invisible from here. What changes is that the next attempt names it, which turns twenty minutes of elimination into ten seconds of reading.

## D72: April has its own API key, which is why April alone can be dead

**Adopted 27 August 2026.** Marrs: *"April is not working."* Then, after D70 made the errors honest: *"Its not creits."*

Not 402, Vercel's runtime logs are 403 for this team, and the model still exists on OpenRouter's public list. That left guessing, so `/console/marketing/llm-probe` makes the calls itself and prints what comes back.

### The lead the probe exists to test

**April does not use the console's key.** `article-draft.ts` and `draft.ts` both pass `apiKey: process.env.APRIL_OPENROUTER_API_KEY`, and the OpenRouter client falls back to `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` **only when that is unset**.

So a rotated, revoked or truncated April key breaks April specifically while every other LLM call in the console keeps working. Which is precisely the reported shape: April is down and nothing else is complaining.

That was a deliberate design (per-agent keys so an agent's cognition bills to its own account), and the cost of it is this failure mode. Worth keeping, worth knowing about.

### So it calls with both keys and prints both answers

One working and the other refusing **is** the diagnosis, and the page computes the conclusion rather than leaving it to be spotted:

- April's fails, console's works → **the April key**, replace it, nothing else was affected.
- April's works, console's fails → the fallback is broken, April is fine, something else is not.
- Both fail identically → the account or the model, not a key.
- Both work → not the key at all, read the third call.

### The third call is the one that catches a non-outage

A deliberately low ceiling, because the production model reasons before it answers and those tokens count against `max_tokens`: below the floor the whole budget goes on thinking and the response is an **empty string** rather than an error. That has bitten this codebase twice. If the two generous calls answer and the low one comes back empty, the fault is a ceiling somewhere in the prompt layer and not the provider.

### It never prints a key, and it does print lengths

Set or unset, plus the character count, because **a truncated paste is a real cause** and the length is the only safe way to see it. An OpenRouter key normally runs to the 60s or 70s of characters, so a 40 is visible as wrong without ever showing a character of it.

### What it costs

Three tiny completions per load, sequential rather than parallel: three at once against a key being rate limited turns one 429 into three and makes the answer harder to read.

## D73: When we cannot classify an error, say where it came from

**Adopted 27 August 2026.** Marrs, after D70 made the messages honest: **"April failed: Maximum call stack size exceeded"**.

That is a `RangeError` from **our own code**, not a provider answer. D70 was the right change and this is the gap it left: the unclassified branch handed back the exception text and nothing else, and for an internal fault the text is the least useful half.

### What the message alone cost

An hour of elimination, all of it recorded here so the next person does not repeat it. Each of these was checked and **cleared with evidence**, not assertion:

- **The markdown stripper from D57.** The obvious suspect, since it shipped hours earlier into this exact path. Run against a 2,660 character article and then against six pathological inputs (60 unbalanced asterisks, 60 unbalanced underscores, a 4,000 character run with one asterisk, `a_b` repeated 1,500 times): **0ms, no throw**, arithmetic and `snake_case` intact.
- **The code-fence unwrap**, pre-existing and the better suspect, because `^```...([\s\S]*?)\s*```$` has nested quantifiers and a truncated reply opens a fence it never closes. Tested at 2.5k, 5k and 10k characters, closed and unclosed: **0ms**. V8 handles it.
- **The streaming loop and the plain completion.** Read both. No recursion, no spread-into-call, nothing that grows the stack.
- **The model.** `google/gemini-3.5-flash` still present on OpenRouter's live public list.
- **The account.** He confirmed it is not credits.
- **Vercel's runtime logs**, which return 403 for this team, and the CLI, which is not on PATH.

### The fix is not a guess

**An unclassifiable error now carries the top of its stack**: three frames, as `file:line`, with the build's long prefixes trimmed to the last two path segments. That is the difference between "something broke" and "it broke here", and it turns the next attempt into a location instead of another hour.

**Only on that branch.** A 402 needs no stack, and every classified case already names its own fix, so adding frames there would be noise on the messages that are already working.

Redacted like everything else, and a thrown non-Error simply has no stack to take rather than crashing the reporter.

### The honest state

**The bug is not fixed.** It is not in any of the six places checked, and I stopped guessing rather than keep going: five wrong hypotheses in a row is a signal to change instrument, not to try a sixth. The next click names the file.

## D74: laneVoice called itself, and Gate 2 was dead for a week

**Adopted 27 August 2026.** Marrs: **"April failed: Maximum call stack size exceeded [chunks/4026.js:1:2663 <- chunks/4026.js:1:2670 <- chunks/4026.js:1:2670]"**

### The bug, in one line

```ts
function laneVoice(lane: NarrativeLane): string {
  return laneVoice(lane) ?? KIND_VOICE[streamKind(lane)];   // the FUNCTION, not the MAP
}
```

It should have been `LANE_VOICE[lane]`. I typed the function's own name in place of the map it was meant to read, in **D45, a week ago**, and the commit that did it describes the intended behaviour correctly in its own message: *"The article's lane register falls back to the kind."*

Unconditional infinite recursion. So `draftArticle` and `reviseArticle` both threw, which means **Gate 2, the article and April's chat on it, has been completely broken since 20 August**. It went unnoticed because the week's work was Gates 3 to 5: the kit, the hero, the templates, the calendar and the wave.

### Why nothing caught it

- **TypeScript cannot.** `laneVoice(lane)` returns `string`, and `string ?? x` is legal, not an error. The `??` silently became unreachable code.
- **No lint runs here.** `next lint` is not configured; it prompts for setup.
- **`LANE_VOICE` became unused** and nothing objects to an unused module const.
- **D45's tests covered the wrong invariant.** That commit added a per-stream check over the KIT, and its message says a lane whose defaults resolve to nothing should be "a test failure rather than a dead screen". The sentiment was right and the check did not reach this line.

### The two frames were the whole diagnosis

`4026.js:1:2670 <- 4026.js:1:2670`, the **same offset twice**, is direct self-recursion rather than deep recursion. That is what turned an hour of elimination into a five-minute scan: a regex over every function in `lib/` for one whose own body calls its own name returned eight candidates, and exactly one of them sat in the article path.

Which is the argument for D73 in a sentence. The message alone (`Maximum call stack size exceeded`) had already cost an hour across five wrong hypotheses; the location cost minutes.

### What went in with the fix

`laneVoice` is **exported** now, purely so it can be tested, and every lane is asserted to return real instruction text without throwing. Calling it *is* most of the test, because the failure was a throw rather than a wrong answer. The overrides are checked too, since a fallback-only implementation would pass a weaker test.

The same scan cleared the rest of the codebase: the only other self-call in a return, `parseFigureReply`, calls a different function.

## D75: The linter, and the receipt for why

**Adopted 27 August 2026.** Marrs: *"set up the linter. I dont know what that is, but i'll trust you that we need it."*

### What it is, since he asked

A program that reads the code looking for mistakes a compiler is not allowed to complain about. TypeScript checks that the types line up. A linter checks for things that type-check perfectly and are still obviously wrong.

### The receipt, tested rather than argued

D74 was `return laneVoice(lane) ?? KIND_VOICE[...]`, a function calling itself where it meant to read a map. It type-checked, it shipped, and Gate 2 was dead for a week.

The bug was **put back temporarily** to check the linter actually earns its place:

| | Verdict |
|---|---|
| ESLint | **error** · `'LANE_VOICE' is assigned a value but never used` |
| TypeScript | **silent** · zero mentions |

The map the line was supposed to read became referenced by nothing, and that is the tell. `no-constant-binary-expression` was the other candidate and it did not fire on this shape, so the honest credit goes to `no-unused-vars`. Both are on.

### Deliberately narrow, and that is the design

`eslint-config-next` brings hundreds of rules and this codebase has never been linted, so turning everything on produces a wall that gets ignored, which is **worse than no linter**: a warning nobody reads trains people to skip warnings.

So the rule set is small and every entry is a correctness rule. Errors: unused vars, constant binary expressions, self-assign, self-compare, unreachable code, duplicate cases, unmodified loop conditions. Off, with reasons written next to them: `no-explicit-any` (used deliberately at store boundaries that validate immediately after), `no-console` (the probes print raw diagnostics on purpose), `no-await-in-loop` (the wave and the slide run await in loops by design).

**The list grows when a bug shows us which rule was missing.** That is how it earned its first two entries.

### 20 errors existed. All 20 are fixed.

Not suppressed. Among them, three worth naming:

- **A dead import I left yesterday** in `media/generate/route.ts`: `generateImages`, orphaned when D62 moved that route onto the dispatcher. The linter found it the first time it ran.
- **Four `<a href="/">` links to internal pages**, which do a full page reload instead of client navigation. Behaviour, not style, which is why that rule is an error.
- **A loop whose condition contained something that never changed**, hiding the bound that actually mattered. Not an infinite loop, since `n <= 50` held it, but it read like one.

### It gates the build

`prebuild` now runs `check:css && lint:ci`, so a lint **error** stops a deploy. `--quiet` means warnings never do: 16 remain, mostly `alt` on images composed inside `next/og`, where the rule is a false positive because nobody reads a Satori canvas with a screen reader.

That is the whole point. D74 reached production because nothing stood between the typo and the deploy.

## D76: Deleting a narrative, without leaving something behind that publishes itself

**Adopted 27 August 2026.** Marrs: *"i need a way to delete 'Narratives' on the dashboard."*

`deleteNarrative` already existed in the store with no route and no button, so nothing could reach it.

### A narrative is not one record, and that is the whole design

It owns pieces, and after Gate 5 it owns calendar entries, some of which may be sitting in Metricool waiting to go out. A delete that removed only the narrative would leave two kinds of debris, and **the second kind publishes itself**: posts from a narrative he deleted, appearing days later, with nothing in the console left to explain them.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Taken with it** | the narrative, its pieces, its draft calendar entries |
| **Refused** | an entry scheduled and not yet gone out |
| **Accepted** | an entry already published |

**The refusal is the important one.** A scheduled post is live on Metricool's side and removing our row would not stop it, so the delete stops, names which posts and when, and says to cancel them in Metricool first. Unscheduling is an outward-facing action and should be a deliberate act rather than a side effect of tidying a board.

**Published entries do not block it.** That post exists in the world and deleting our row changes nothing about it. Refusing there would make old narratives undeletable forever, which is the opposite of what he asked for.

### Three orderings that matter

- **The calendar is checked before anything is removed**, so a refusal leaves the narrative exactly as it was. Deleting the pieces and then discovering a live post would be the worst possible order.
- **A calendar read failure refuses too.** If we cannot see the calendar then whether anything is live is unknown, and deleting on an unknown is how a post goes out from a narrative nobody can find.
- **On the way down: entries, then pieces, then the narrative.** The narrative is the index everything else is found through, so removing it first would orphan whatever failed after it with no way back to it.

Partial failures are reported rather than swallowed: the narrative is gone either way, which is what he asked for, and an orphaned piece is a thing he should know exists.

### The button is a sibling of the row, not a child

The lane row is a `<Link>`, and **a `<button>` inside an `<a>` is invalid HTML** whose click resolves to whichever the browser prefers: it either navigates or deletes, unpredictably. So the row is wrapped and the button sits beside it, positioned over the bottom-right corner, clear of the gate label above and the piece dots beside it, with 38px of row padding so nothing runs under it.

Verified in a browser rather than assumed: the button is not inside the anchor, it sits within the row's bounds, and a click on it does not navigate.

**Quiet but not hidden**, in coral on hover. A reveal-on-hover control is undiscoverable, and he asked for this because he could not find one.

## D77: A real post went out, and it corrected three things

**Adopted 27 August 2026.** Marrs: *"I posted a LinkedIn post, and it got scheduled fine for 5:00 PM today. I checked on Metricool, and it was all up. The image was in, and it was looking good."*

**Todo item 2 is closed.** The publish button has now been pressed against a real brand, the payload was right, the media url was fetchable from their side, and the timezone landed. Everything downstream of Gate 5 has stopped being theory. Then he reported three faults, and two of them turned out to be one.

### The preview showed the whole post, so the image fell off the screen

*"the image that I was selecting wasn't showing in our preview... The way it was showing the text was a bit weird. It wasn't the same as it would have on LinkedIn. It would have just shown the first two lines, then it says More and then condenses all of that up and then has an image."*

D59 rendered the tail of the post **dimmed rather than hidden**, reasoning that showing the shape of what is hidden beats cutting it. That was wrong, and it was wrong twice:

1. It misrepresents the platform, which collapses.
2. **It hid the image.** An 1,884 character post rendered in full pushed the picture below the bottom of the viewport, so an attached image looked missing. One bug, two symptoms, and the second one is the one he noticed.

Collapsed now. On his real post the card carries **69 characters instead of 405**, so the image sits directly under two lines. How much is hidden is said as a number under the card, which is the honest place for a fact about the copy rather than part of the copy.

### His screenshot is better evidence than the spec was

The fold rule came from third-party consensus: 140 characters, or three line breaks. **Metricool's own preview cut his post at 69 characters**, at the first paragraph break, nowhere near 140.

Their preview is a far better source than a blog aggregating other blogs, so the rule is now **the first paragraph OR 140 characters, whichever comes first**, and his actual published copy is the test fixture with the expected cut being what Metricool actually showed him.

Two details that came out of writing it: a **single** newline is not a paragraph break, or a two-line opening would be cut in half and reported as the fold; and a post written as one long block still gets the character cap, or a wall of text would report as fully visible purely because it has no blank line in it.

### The "View in Metricool" link went to a 404

*"It probably should just redirect straight to the calendar page."*

`https://app.metricool.com/planning` is not a path they serve; it redirects to `/public/error/404`. It was written when nothing had ever clicked it.

His working url is `/planner/calendar`, and the one he was actually looking at carries `blogId` and `userId`, so the link now opens the calendar **for that stream's brand** rather than whichever brand the session last had open. With five streams mapped to five brands that is the difference between a useful link and a confusing one. A missing `METRICOOL_USER_ID` degrades to the default brand rather than breaking.

There is no per-post deep link to build: their API returns an id and documents no url for one, which is the same open question the analytics join turns on.

### How this was verified

The fold is measured rather than eyeballed: 405 characters in, 69 rendered, 334 hidden, and the rendered text asserted to equal his opening line exactly. **The image's position in the card was not re-checked in a browser this time**, because another session holds port 3000; it is unchanged from the D59 layout that was verified at 1100px, where the image rendered correctly under short copy. The bug was never the position, it was the length of what preceded it.

## D78: The probe asked with the wrong parameter names, and the answer was already in the payload

**Adopted 28 August 2026.** Marrs ran the probe on three streams and sent the output.

### All five analytics calls returned 500, and it was mine

```
{"status":"INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR","code":"500","title":"InternalError",
 "detail":"Required request parameter 'from' for method parameter type String is not present"}
```

I sent `start` and `end`. **They want `from` and `to`.** The names came from the `besttimes` endpoint, which really does take `start`/`end`, and I assumed the analytics endpoints matched their sibling. They do not.

Read from their OpenAPI spec this time rather than inferred: `from`, `to`, optional `timezone`, and **both dates are full ISO 8601 datetimes** (`2021-01-01T10:00:00`), not the bare dates I was sending, which was the second thing wrong. `/timelines` additionally requires `network` and `metric`, neither of which has a documented enum.

**What the failure told us anyway, which is a lot.** A 500 whose body names the missing parameter means the path exists, the token authenticated, and the brand id resolved. **A tier refusal would have been 401 or 403.** So question 1 is still formally unanswered but the encouraging half is settled: nothing about his account is blocking these calls.

Question 2 could not be answered at all, and the probe said so correctly: every stream showed 0 calendar entries, so there were no ids of ours to compare. His published post is on a piece the probe's stream filter did not match, which is the next thing to check.

### Gate 3 was answered by a payload we were already receiving

`/admin/simpleProfiles` returned 200, and inside it, per brand:

```
"instagram":"polynize.ai"   "tiktok":"polynize.ai"
"linkedinCompany":"urn:li:organization:18565952"   "youtube":null
```

**Non-null means connected.** No manual toggles needed, and the answer was sitting in a response the Connect page has been making all along.

Confirmed against the spec rather than one screenshot: `PublicBlog` carries twelve platform fields, all typed string.

**LinkedIn needs three fields, not one**, and this is the part that would have broken quietly. There is no plain `linkedin`: a company page arrives as `linkedinCompany`, a personal profile as `inUserId` or `linkedInUserProfileURL`. Checking only the company field would have hidden LinkedIn on every personal lane, which is four of the five people here and the platform he cares most about.

**It fails open, deliberately.** Not configured, not mapped, call failed, brand absent: every network shows. Hiding work because a config read timed out is worse than offering a platform he cannot post to, because he would have no way to tell that from "we decided not to post there". An empty list, though, is an *answer* rather than an absence, and does hide everything.

Cached for ten minutes, because Gate 3 renders often and a brand's connections change roughly never. Passed as an ARRAY, not a Set: the gate is a client component and a Set crosses that boundary as an empty object, which would have silently hidden every network.

His own Polynize brand payload is the test fixture.

## D79: One queue, per platform, and it is ours

**Adopted 28 August 2026.** Marrs, on what he expected "Add to queue" to be:

> "I want to know what that feature does, because I'm assuming that somewhere in Metricool there is a queue section. I can, for each of the brands, dictate on each of the platforms what time and how many posts per day to do on each platform, and then it just adds to that queue. That's ideally what I'd like, so I can set that once and just go add to queue, add to queue."

His mental model is right. Two things about it were wrong on our side.

### Metricool has no queue, so the queue is ours

Their API creates a post at a concrete `publicationDate`. There is no append-to-queue call anywhere in their 528 paths (checked, `docs/pam-console/metricool-api.md`). So "add to queue" means "work out the next free slot on this channel and schedule at that exact time", computed here. The queue exists, it just lives in this console rather than in theirs.

### There were two slot tables and the button read the wrong one

`pam/config/posting-schedule.json` held per-STREAM times and had the only UI. `pam/channel-schedule/{lane}.json` held the per-NETWORK times, modes and slot kinds that the wave actually uses, and was edited by nothing. So the operator could set posting times all day and change nothing that shipped, while the queue consumed slots from a list the wave never looked at.

I had recorded this as todo item 16 rather than as a bug, which undersold it. **A settings screen wired to a store nothing reads is worse than no settings screen, because it answers the question wrongly.** D68 patched the timezone half of it and I left the rest.

The lane file is now the single authority:

- **Connect Metricool edits it**, per network per stream: LinkedIn, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube each get their own times.
- **The number of times IS the posts-per-day answer.** Two times on LinkedIn means two LinkedIn posts a day. No separate count field, because a count and a list of times can disagree and then something has to decide which wins.
- **"Add to queue" and the wave now call the same function on the same table**, so they agree by construction rather than by coincidence.
- **The queue is per platform.** LinkedIn's queue no longer fills up because Instagram was busy, and an occupied slot on that channel is skipped rather than doubled.
- **Mode is on the screen too** (auto / by hand), because it had nowhere to be seen: his own LinkedIn is hand-posted by default (D41), so a LinkedIn post on his lane never goes through Metricool at all, and without this control that reads as a bug rather than a choice.

The old per-stream `slots` are no longer written but their values are carried over rather than cleared. A dead field is not worth destroying data over.

### The save echoes back what was stored

The store falls back to a network's defaults when its time list arrives empty, which is right for a broken config file and reads as a failed save if you clear a field on purpose: you would type nothing, save, and find `08:30` back in the box on your next visit with nothing having said so. `saveChannelSchedule` now returns the normalized result and the screen adopts it, so the correction happens in front of you.

### Capacity was answered with a sentence, not a limit

Todo item 9 wanted enforcement. It does not need any: the slots ARE the capacity, so a third LinkedIn post on a two-slot day lands tomorrow and nothing can be double-booked. What was missing was anyone saying so. Press the button eleven times and the eleventh post is a week and a half out, which is fine if you meant it and a nasty surprise if you did not.

So the queue now reports its depth when the slot it took is a week or more out, and **in amber under the entry rather than in coral**: a queue three weeks deep is a fact, not a fault, and painting a successful add as a failure is how a useful sentence gets learned as noise. A hard cap was rejected. The point of the button is that it can be pressed repeatedly without thinking.

Also: the confirm dialog now says what the button does, since that is what he asked. Which platform's queue, where the times come from, and that it goes to Metricool at that time.

## D80: A door for work that is already finished

**Adopted 1 September 2026.** Marrs:

> "I recorded that video. It's edited. I've got three versions of it, and I'm not sure how to post it using the console, which is an issue."

He was right, and the reason is worth stating plainly: **every route into the calendar started from a Story.** The console could make a video and publish one it had made, and had nothing to say to a finished file.

### The door already existed once, for podcast clips, and was one word from working

`podcast/[id]/clip/render/route.ts` mints a piece from finished, already-rendered video with the media attached and the status approved. Its own header says what it is for: the clip becomes an ordinary marketing piece with an ordinary media asset attached, so the calendar and the Metricool tail need no knowledge of podcasts at all. That is exactly the shape needed here. It could not be reused only because it is gated on a Descript project.

**And it carried the bug that made this hard to see.** It set `kind: 'video'`, and `kind` picks the screen: video opens the SCRIPT screen, which edits the words you are about to say, offers a teleprompter and a "ready to record" switch, and has **no caption field and no route to the calendar**. So a clip that was already cut opened on a screen asking the operator to write and then perform it, and the caption it shipped with was machine text that could not be edited anywhere in the console.

A finished file needs the CAPTION module. `kind: 'text'` selects it, and that screen already has the media picker, the platform preview, the approve gate and the button that puts it on the calendar. **The kind describes what has to be done to the piece, not what the file is.** One shared shape now, `lib/marketing/finished-media.ts`, and `finished_media` is a registered format so `kindOf` resolves it instead of defaulting to video.

### The door is one button on the file, not a new screen

A video only reaches this console as a pasted Box direct link, because video upload is refused with that reason (the bucket is private and a video is too large to stream through the console). So the operator is already standing in the media library, and that is where the door goes: **"Post this"** on the asset. Three cuts is three presses rather than one form filled in three times, and it is idempotent per asset, so a second press reopens the same piece. Two pieces carrying the same file would have become two sets of calendar entries and the same video would go out twice.

No platforms are preset. The wave picks platforms from a kit where the choice was made deliberately; here nobody has chosen anything, and only the operator knows whether this is the vertical cut or the wide one.

### Five things that would have made the door produce wrong posts

Found by walking the flow against the code rather than by reasoning about the design.

1. **Platforms were read-only chips, editable nowhere in the console.** `prepare` refuses a piece with no platforms and says "re-plan it with at least one platform", and there was no screen where a platform could be set. A piece made from finished media starts with none, so the door could not have worked at all. They are buttons now, saved through the same snapshot discipline as everything else on that screen (D63).

2. **`publish_mode` was honoured by the wave and by nothing else.** Both of the calendar's own buttons, Schedule and Add to queue, called `publishEntry` directly, so an entry stamped 'manual' went through Metricool anyway. That is not cosmetic: his personal LinkedIn is hand-posted for a measured reason, and finished video is exactly the content most likely to go there. `shipEntry` now dispatches on the mode, and `prepare` stamps it (it never did).

3. **A YouTube post went out with no title.** Read off Metricool's OpenAPI spec today rather than assumed: `ScheduledPost` carries `youtubeData.title`, alongside `tiktokData`, `linkedinData` and `instagramData`. We sent none of them, so `text` became the description and the video published untitled. The kit has promised a Short "its own 100-character title" since D49 and nothing could deliver it. Now sent, capped at YouTube's own 100.

4. **"Add to queue" on a channel with no posting times was a 500.** The calendar offers the button on any channel Metricool can reach, which includes X; the slot finder spread an undefined default and threw, which the board rendered as "Could not add to the queue" with nothing to act on. Now a sentence naming the four channels that have a queue.

5. **The em-dash rule had a hole exactly where a human writes.** The strip was applied to April's output only, so the fallback path, which uses the operator's own copy, was the one path that could ship an em dash. It rarely showed while every draft was model written. A caption typed for a finished video makes it the normal case.

Also: `prepare` makes an LLM call and had no `maxDuration`, unlike every other model route in marketing, so a slow adaptation was killed mid-flight and left the piece with no entries and no explanation. And the preview resolved the selection down to images, so a post whose whole content is one video showed a caption floating in furniture while the picker said "1 attached", which reads as the video having failed to attach. It now names the attached file rather than drawing a player that may not decode a Box link.

### April no longer rewrites what he wrote

`prepare` adapted the copy per platform unconditionally and never read its request body, so there was no way to decline. Adapting is right when the copy came from an article and has to reach four feeds with different registers; it is wrong when he wrote the caption himself for one file. There is a checkbox now, defaulted by where the words came from: a piece with a source adapts as it always has, a piece made of finished media does not.

### One thing learned in passing, worth acting on later

Their `linkedinData` carries **`publishImagesAsPDF`** and `documentTitle`. That is evidence the blocked LinkedIn document carousel is schedulable after all: "whether Metricool can schedule a LinkedIn document post is unverified" was half the reason that row is off. The other half stands, since this console still has no PDF generation. The full table of per-network options we do not send is now in `docs/pam-console/metricool-api.md`, including `videoThumbnailUrl`, which is the API-level way to honour the house rule that the first frame is the cover.

## D81: The video posted to one platform and Instagram refused it

**Adopted 2 September 2026.** Marrs walked the new door with a real edited video, on his personal stream:

> "The flow was great. Everything worked, but it didn't actually post... It only looked like it tried to post on Instagram when I selected Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube. It looks like it only tried to post on Instagram but had an error. The link seems to be fine because it's playing in Metricool in the right panel."

Two unrelated failures, and then he found the answer key himself by duplicating the post inside Metricool and letting their own validator list what was wrong:

```
Instagram does not allow single-video posts. Change the Instagram post type to REEL
  or add more videos or images.
Video or short title is required and must be shorter than 100 characters.
  The characters < or > are not allowed.
Video -> Invalid video orientation, only horizontal is allowed.
It is necessary to select the audience of the video.
```

**That is a better source than their OpenAPI spec**, and worth remembering as a technique: their composer runs the same validations their API does, so a post assembled by hand in their UI reports exactly what our payload is missing. Three of the four are now fixed and the fourth is answered by a read rather than a guess.

### 1. A video on Instagram is a Reel, or it is refused

We sent no `instagramData` at all, which left Meta's deprecated `VIDEO` media type in place. Their message on the first attempt said so directly: use REELS to publish a video to an Instagram feed.

Now `instagramData: { type: 'REEL' }` whenever the post carries a video. **Whether it carries one is read off the stored asset kind, not off the url**, because a Box direct link need not end in a file extension. That needed `resolveMedia`, which keeps the assets rather than reducing them to urls on the way through.

### 2. YouTube needed two fields, one of which is a declaration

- **`title`**, already added in D80, but capped wrong: their validator says "shorter than 100", so the cap is **99**. An inclusive read of that sentence is a rejected post. Angle brackets are stripped too, since they refuse `<` and `>` and those arrive by accident rather than by intent.
- **`madeForKids: false`**, because "It is necessary to select the audience of the video" is YouTube's made-for-kids declaration and it has no default. False is the truthful answer for everything this console posts, and it is stated in the code rather than left implicit: declaring the other way strips comments and personalisation from the video.

### 3. The one thing that is still a guess, so it is not guessed

A vertical file has to publish as a **Short**, and Metricool refuses it as a video ("only horizontal is allowed"). The field is `youtubeData.type`, and **their spec gives it no values: the word SHORT appears nowhere in 1.2MB of schema.** A wrong token would either be silently ignored or rejected, and from here those two look identical.

So the probe now reads `youtubeData` / `instagramData` / `tiktokData` off his real scheduled posts. Set the dropdown once in Metricool's composer, reload the probe, and the exact token their own UI uses is on screen. Until then the caption screen says plainly, before he presses anything, that a vertical YouTube post has to have its type switched in Metricool.

### 4. Only one platform was prepared, and that was my bug

Nothing to do with Metricool. The platform toggles autosave on a **one second debounce** and the Prepare button POSTed immediately, and the route reads the piece out of the store. Tick two more platforms, press Prepare inside that second, and the server prepares the piece as it was a moment earlier. Three ticked, one prepared, which is exactly what he saw.

Prepare now writes the screen's state and **waits for it** before asking the server to read it, and a failed write stops the prepare instead of preparing something that does not match the screen.

**And the silence was half the bug.** It redirected to the calendar with no report, so one post created out of three ticked looked identical to working. The route has always returned a count and nobody read it; the calendar now says how many posts were prepared, and says to go back and check the ticks if that is fewer than expected.

### What is still unfixed, deliberately

TikTok raised no error in their validator, so it needs nothing. `videoThumbnailUrl` is still unsent, which is the API-level way to honour the house rule that the first frame is the cover.

## D82: The YouTube title is the first line of the post, and it is shown

**Adopted 2 September 2026.** Marrs:

> "Is there a way we can take the first line of the post and make that the YouTube title, or how are we making that up? Are you selecting that yourself?"

His suggestion is better than what shipped in D80, and the question is the right one to ask of anything derived and invisible.

**What it was doing.** `youtubeTitleFrom(entry.title, entry.post_copy)`: the piece title first, the first line of the copy only as a fallback. **The piece title is an internal filing name in every case that exists.** A post made from finished media is titled with the media library's label, which is whatever was typed when pasting a Box link. A post from a Story is titled `<the headline>: Numbered rules`. Neither is a thing anyone would put on YouTube, and his video would have gone out titled with a filename.

**What it does now.** The first line of the post, with the label as the fallback for a post that has no copy yet. His own post opens "Is this AI Business Advice BS?", which is a better YouTube title than any heuristic would assemble, because it is the one sentence in the whole piece written to be read.

**And it is printed on the caption screen**, which is the real answer to "are you selecting that yourself". A derived value nobody can see is a guess with extra steps. The screen shows the exact string that will be sent, its length against the 99 cap, and one line saying that changing the first line changes it. Same function as the publish path, so the screen and the payload cannot disagree.

Two details worth keeping:

- **Trimmed at a word boundary**, never mid-word. A long opening line cut at exactly 99 characters lands inside a word and reads as a fault rather than as a title. Same 60% floor as the post preview's fold, and for the same reason: backing up to a space is only an improvement while the result is still most of the line.
- **The rules moved to their own pure module** (`lib/marketing/youtube-title.ts`). The caption screen is a client island, and importing the Metricool client to show a title would put the publishing layer in the browser bundle (D47).

## D83: A date with no time became 09:00, and nobody checked 09:00 had not passed

**Adopted 2 September 2026.** Marrs dated a post today, left the time blank, and pressed Schedule. Metricool refused it:

```
Invalid value 'DateTimeInfo(dateTime=2026-09-02T09:00:00, timezone=Australia/Sydney)'.
Given datetime cannot be in the past.
```

**He never chose 09:00.** A constant inside `toDateTime` did, because a date with no time needed one, and by the time he pressed the button 9am that day was hours gone. Two mistakes in one line: inventing a time at all, and then never asking whether the invented one was reachable.

### The invented time now comes from his own posting times

A date with no time means "post it that day", and the console already knows when this channel posts on this lane: the same per-network slots the queue and the wave read (D79). So the first slot on that date that has not passed is used, which is both a better answer than a constant and consistent with everything else the console does. LinkedIn on a lane with 08:30, 12:30 and 17:00, dated today at 2pm, goes at 17:00.

If every slot on that date has gone, it is **refused rather than moved**. Rolling it to tomorrow would silently override the one thing he did specify, which is the date.

### A past time is refused here, in a sentence

The old path sent it and let Metricool refuse it, which arrives as a 400 carrying a Java object inside XML. That is not something an operator can act on. The refusal now names the time, says it has passed, and gives the two ways out: pick a later time, or use Add to queue.

**And the resolved time is written back onto the entry.** A card still reading as a bare date after the console picked 17:00 cannot be checked against Metricool, and a second press would re-derive against a later "now" and pick a different slot.

The timezone decides what "past" means, and that is asserted: the same instant is still the previous evening in California, so Kristin's whole day is ahead when Marrs's is half gone.

`toDateTime` is deleted. Nothing else called it.

### And the probe read that was meant to answer the YouTube question 400'd, for the same reason

```
{"start":"Invalid value '2026-06-04'. Valid format is: date-time in format yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss"}
```

Bare dates where they want datetimes. **Second time on this API**, after D78, so it is now a written rule rather than a per-endpoint discovery: every date parameter Metricool takes is a full ISO datetime, whatever it is called. The parameter NAMES differ by endpoint family (`from`/`to` for analytics, `start`/`end` for the scheduler) and the format never does. The table is in `docs/pam-console/metricool-api.md`.

Worth saying: a 400 that names the field and prints the expected pattern is a good failure. It cost one reload rather than an afternoon.

## D84: The tokens, read off his own account rather than guessed

**Adopted 2 September 2026.** Marrs set the YouTube type to Short in Metricool's composer and sent the probe output back. It answered the question exactly:

```
"youtubeData": { "title": "Which Type are You?", "type": "short", "privacy": "public",
                 "tags": ["AI","Futureofwork","AIEconomy"], "category": "SCIENCE_TECHNOLOGY",
                 "madeForKids": false }
"instagramData": { "autoPublish": true, "type": "REEL", "showReelOnFeed": true,
                   "isAiGenerated": false }
"linkedinData": { "previewIncluded": true, "type": "POST" }
"tiktokData": { "privacyOption": "PUBLIC_TO_EVERYONE", "photoCoverIndex": 0 }
```

**`short`, lowercase.** And the case is not consistent across their API: YouTube's is lowercase, Instagram's `REEL` and LinkedIn's `POST` are upper. That is the whole argument for reading these rather than assuming them, and it is why the probe existed instead of a plausible guess.

### What is now sent

- **`youtubeData.type: 'short'`** when the post carries a video, which is what stops the "Invalid video orientation, only horizontal is allowed" rejection.
- **`youtubeData.privacy: 'public'`**, explicitly, even though nothing complained about it. YouTube is the one channel this console had never successfully published to, and an unseen default that turned out to be private would be a post that went out invisible. That is the worst class of failure to notice.
- **`instagramData.showReelOnFeed: true`** alongside the REEL type, because that is what his own composer sends and it puts the Reel on the profile grid rather than only in the Reels tab.
- **Not sent: `category` and `tags`.** Editorial choices with no source in this console, and Metricool clearly defaults them.

### A landscape video sends no type at all

Its token is not in his data. The default already accepts horizontal video, since the rejection was specific to orientation, so the behaviour we had is the right behaviour for that case. **Sending nothing is the only option here with no guess in it.**

### The one thing the file cannot tell us

Nothing on a media asset says which way up a video is. So the caption screen asks once, next to the YouTube title readout, and it defaults to **Short**, because everything this pipeline can currently produce for YouTube is vertical: the kit's only YouTube video row is Shorts, and long form is blocked for want of an edit pipeline.

Stamped onto the entry at prepare time, exactly like `publish_mode` and `timezone` before it. **The rule keeps earning its place: anything decided while authoring travels on the entry rather than being re-derived at ship time.**

### TikTok needed a privacy option, and I had said it needed nothing

Marrs, minutes later: "Also got an error on a TikTok post." Metricool's publisher:

```
Publish Tiktok video error: does not specified privacy options
```

Their composer rendered the field as the literal string `planner.planner.presets.tiktok.privacyStatus.null`, which is an untranslated i18n key: their UI's way of showing a null. He fixed it himself in one move: "I basically just had to flick 'Who can view your post?' to public, and it was fine."

**I got this wrong, and the mistake is worth naming.** When their form validator listed four errors on a three-network post, TikTok raised none, and I read that silence as TikTok needing nothing. It needed something their form does not validate and their publisher does. **A validator's silence is not a guarantee.** The same trap is presumably still open on fields nothing has complained about yet.

`tiktokData.privacyOption: 'PUBLIC_TO_EVERYONE'`, copied from his own scheduled post, and it is TikTok's own documented enum rather than a Metricool invention. Comments, duet and stitch are left alone: permissive defaults, matching his composer.

**And one more unseen default closed while here.** His posts all carry `instagramData.autoPublish: true`. If Metricool's default were false, an Instagram post would land as a phone reminder rather than publishing, which would look exactly like a post that silently never went out. It is now sent as `!draft`, so it mirrors the top-level flag instead of trusting a default nobody can see.

### Also in that probe, for the analytics build

The join is confirmed broken the expected way: ours are Metricool integers (`367684553`), theirs are LinkedIn URNs (`urn:li:ugcPost:7500343632873517056`). Nothing new. **But `GET /v2/scheduler/posts` now works and returns whole posts**, which is the second read the analytics join needs: it carries `providers`, and `ProviderStatus` is where `id` and `publicUrl` live. The fallback join is no longer hypothetical, it is one field extraction away.

## D85: The calendar could not tell you what had already gone out, and the media library was a stack

**Adopted 2 September 2026.** Two rounds of feedback from Marrs while he was testing the video posts.

### The calendar had three states and needed four

> "I have a post from Monday, the 31st of August, the Emergent AI one. It says 'scheduled'. It should already say 'posted' in a slightly faded grey and a bit out of the way somewhere, just so it's not the first thing that we focus on. There just needs to be a clear line that says 'today' below this."

An entry read Draft, Planned or Scheduled, and **Scheduled never changed again**, so a post from three days ago sat there looking like something still to come.

- **Posted**, in grey, for a scheduled entry whose time has passed.
- **A today line** across the board, before the first day that is not behind us, so it appears even when today has nothing on it. Days above it are dimmed to 55%, not hidden: he asked for the past out of the way, not gone, and a calendar that forgets what it published is no use for deciding what to publish next.
- The scheduling buttons already disappeared once an entry was sent, so history was already inert. It just did not say so.

**"Posted" is inferred from the clock, and that is stated in the code and in the tooltip.** Nothing in this console has ever confirmed a post actually went out: `status` reaches 'scheduled' when Metricool accepts it and there is no callback and no nightly pull. So this means "Metricool said it would publish this, and the moment has passed". The analytics second read is what turns it into a fact, and when it lands it **replaces** this inference rather than sitting beside it.

**The entry's own timezone decides what "passed" means**, not the reader's browser. A Kristin post at 08:30 Los Angeles is still hours away when Sydney has finished the day, and treating the reader's clock as the truth would mark it posted before it happened. Computed after mount only, like the month view's today cell, because the server and the browser do not share a clock and a differing label is a hydration mismatch.

### The media library was four forms in a column

> "The sections look all the same... instead of showing four or five separate sections, we have just one tab that says Media Library across the top... When you click one, it doesn't open a separate tab, instead it moves to the next tab across. This keeps it neat because at the moment everything in a stack is a bit visually confusing."

He is right, and the reason is worth naming: **three of the four sections are tools you apply to an image and one is the library you look at.** Stacked in a single column they all look like the same kind of thing. Four tabs say which is which, with the library first because it is what you came to see.

**Purely layout.** Each panel already owned its own picker and its own state, so the four children are still built on the server exactly as before and handed to a client shell that only decides which is visible.

**Every panel stays mounted and hidden rather than unmounted**, which is the point: a half-typed generation prompt survives a look at the library and back. Losing a prompt to a stray click is the kind of small betrayal that makes a tool feel unreliable.

Panel titles went from 18px to 30px, as asked. And `(brand-standard)` is gone from the text overlay heading: he read it as meaningless, and he was right, because it described the implementation rather than the job.

### The video tiles were black squares

> "Most of the videos have just got a black screen. What would be ideal is that we just make the first frame of the video the thumbnail. If that's not possible, I just need a title."

Both, and the browser does the work: a real `<video>` element with `preload="metadata"` and a `#t=0.1` fragment paints the opening frame. **Not `#t=0`**, because some encoders open on a black or empty frame and a tenth of a second in is past it. It falls back to the old play glyph if the browser cannot decode the link.

Nothing else could have produced a frame here: the file is a Box link, and pulling a video through a serverless function to run a decoder over it is not something to do for a grid of thumbnails.

**And the title was there all along, squeezed to an ellipsis.** It shared one `white-space: nowrap` line with the Post this and Delete buttons inside a 150px tile. It now has its own row above them, two lines, at a readable size. Worth remembering: *"I can't see the title"* meant the layout had eaten it, not that it was missing.

## D86: The analytics panel draws real numbers

**Adopted 2 September 2026.** Marrs: *"Can we focus on the analytics dashboards now? I'd love to get those up and running."*

Everything the spike settled (D69, D78, D84) pointed at one call, and this is the build on top of it.

### One endpoint, not five

`/v2/analytics/brand-summary/posts` returns every post on a brand across every network in one call, each with its text, url, publication date, type and a normalised metric block. Proven against his account: 31 posts over 90 days on the Marrs brand, **including posts he published by hand**, which is the part that makes it worth having. D41 made his personal LinkedIn manual and this feed enumerates it anyway.

The four per-network endpoints carry more fields (LinkedIn's clicks, Instagram's saves and follows, Reels' watch time and skip rate) in four different shapes. Starting with the cross-network feed means the panel is real today off one proven call, and the richer fields are an addition rather than a rewrite.

### Absent is not zero, and the code is built around that distinction

Every sum in the summariser is optional all the way to the tile. If no post in the window reported impressions, the tile says **"no data yet"** rather than 0, because **0 impressions is a claim** and a different one from the platform not having told us. The engagement average ignores the posts that reported no rate, rather than counting them as 0% and dragging the number down on the strength of a figure nobody gave us.

**The trend is zero-filled, and that is correct, which is the distinction worth keeping straight.** A week with no posts really did earn no impressions, so a gap in the line is a fact. A missing metric is an absence. The two are computed differently on purpose.

### The delta tiles are gone

Every tile used to carry "+12% vs last 12 weeks". The mock could always produce that and the real feed cannot: one pull is one window, and comparing it to a previous one needs history this store does not keep by design. **A delta is the single easiest number to fake convincingly**, so it is absent rather than approximated, and `signedPct` was deleted with it rather than kept warm.

### The mock is deleted, not disabled

A mock generator left beside a live dashboard is one import away from being drawn again, and the whole risk of a mock is that somebody decides on it. The formatting it carried (compacting a count, laying out a sparkline) was never fake and moved to `analytics-format.ts`.

### A button before a cron

The pull has never run against a real account, and **a nightly job that fails at 3am is the worst possible first version of anything**: nobody sees the failure and the dashboard just stays empty. So it is a button, run by a person, whose result is on screen. The cron is the same call on a timer once this is boring.

It never throws. A stream whose brand is unmapped, whose token is refused, or whose call times out records a stored error rather than an exception, because the pull runs over five streams and one bad brand must not cost the other four. Streams run one at a time: five concurrent calls to one account's analytics is the shape of request that gets rate limited, and there is nothing to gain from finishing a background refresh three seconds sooner.

### The store is a cache, not a ledger

One file per stream holding the latest pull. Not live-on-render, for three reasons in order: the panel sits at the bottom of two pages that are opened constantly and would spend the rate limit on scrolling; a Metricool outage would take the dashboard down rather than showing yesterday's numbers; and their feed is a **window**, so a post that falls out of it stops existing and anything we never wrote down is gone.

Not a time series either, yet. Every tile answers "how is this post doing", not "how did it grow". When growth is wanted it should be a second file appended per pull, not a reshape of this one, because the engine page reads five streams and that read has to stay one object each.

### Two bugs the fixtures caught, and both were mine

The reader was tested against his own rows rather than an imagined payload, which is the only reason these were found before he saw them:

1. **TikTok dates its rows with a flat `createTime`.** The brand feed wraps it in `publicationDate.dateTime` and LinkedIn's in `created.dateTime`, and the reader knew the first two. Every TikTok post would have silently lost its place in the trend and in the window.
2. **Only the brand feed says which network a row is from.** The per-network endpoints omit the field, because the caller asked for one network by name. Without a fallback parameter every per-network row lands as `unknown` and the platform breakdown collapses into one meaningless bar. Nothing calls those endpoints yet, so this was a bug shipped ahead of its trigger.

### What is not built yet, and why it is next

**The frame ladder**, which the todo calls the load-bearing tile: each post type ranked by median reach within one voice. It needs the join, because only we know which frame a post was, and the join needs the second read that D84 proved works (`GET /v2/scheduler/posts` carries `providers[].publicUrl`, which matches the `url` on every analytics row). That is the next commit, and it also turns D85's inferred "Posted" into a confirmed one.

## D87: A chart over time, three ranges, and a colour per person

**Adopted 2 September 2026.** Three asks from Marrs after the first real pull, all yes.

### The chart over time

> "I like the visual that you had on the test data, which showed a graph over time. I kind of like that. Is it possible for us to do that for the 90 days?"

A proper line chart, full width, replacing the 104px sparkline that was tucked inside a tile. **Buckets follow the range**: by day up to a month, by week beyond it. Ninety daily points across this width is a comb nobody can read, and four weekly points across a fortnight hides the shape entirely.

The tile sparklines are gone with it, and `sparklinePoints` deleted. Four tiles each carrying the same 104px line was the same picture labelled four different ways.

**Every bucket in the range is drawn, including the empty ones**, and that is the opposite of the rule for the totals. A week with no posts really did earn no impressions, so a flat stretch is a fact; an absent metric is still never a zero. The two rules sit side by side in the code with a pair of assertions marking the boundary.

### Three range buttons

> "Is it possible for us to have a button that says the last week, the last month, and the last 90 days?"

**One pull serves all three.** The store holds 90 days, so a range is a filter over what is already here: switching is instant, costs no API call, and cannot fail halfway. That is the reason the pull window is 90 and not 7.

The filters sit in one row above everything and scope every number below them, so the tiles, the chart, the bars and the table can never disagree about which window they describe. `today` is passed from the server rather than read from the browser clock: a client component renders on the server first, and a clock read there disagrees with the browser's, which is a hydration mismatch rather than a cosmetic difference.

This is also why the panel became a client island, reversing D66's note that it should not cost a client bundle. That was right when there was nothing to interact with. The empty and failed states still render server-side with no bundle at all, which is the common case.

### A colour per person, and where it is allowed to live

> "If we had, for instance, a colour for each of us... part of that colour could be mine, part of it could be Shourov's... I'm not too sure if it's really needed on a global level or if it's just useful on the analytics level."

**Analytics only, and that answers his own question.** The brand already spends colour on a meaning: coral is human, amber is hybrid, mint is agent. Handing coral to Marrs and amber to Shourov would quietly remap the one semantic the brand has, on every screen in the console. Confined to the panel that asks "whose reach is this", a series palette answers a question nothing else on that screen answers, and it never leaves.

**So these are not brand colours.** They are the documented categorical series palette from the house chart guidance, in its fixed slot order, which is what keeps them apart for colourblind readers. **Validated with the guidance's own script against this console's real surfaces rather than eyeballed:**

- dark `#1c1c27`: every check PASS. Worst adjacent CVD ΔE 8.4 (target 8), normal-vision 19.3 (floor 15), contrast all ≥ 3:1.
- light `#f4ece0`: every check PASS except contrast, which WARNs on four of five.

**The light WARN is not dismissable, so it is answered rather than ignored.** The guidance allows a sub-3:1 fill only where the value is readable another way: every bar carries its total as a visible label, the legend names every person in text beside their own avatar, and the table underneath lists the posts. Three relief channels, none of them colour.

**Colour follows the person, never their rank.** The slot is fixed by position in `STREAMS`, so filtering to a shorter range, or one stream out-performing another, never repaints anybody. A chart whose colours move when the data moves is worse than no colour at all. A stream with no slot paints neutral rather than borrowing someone else's identity: showing two people as one is the single failure a colour key must not have.

Segments keep stream order rather than being sorted by size, for the same reason: a person who appears in a different position in every bar is a person the reader has to re-find every time.

### Rendered and looked at

The palette validator checks colour, not layout, so the geometry was rendered standalone with realistic data (a quiet quarter with a spike, some empty weeks, a platform reporting nothing) and inspected for label collisions and overflow before shipping. Both bucket widths read cleanly, the 2px surface gaps between segments are visible at real sizes, and a platform with no reported reach shows "1 post" rather than an empty bar.

## D88: The pull button said nothing, and the colours needed measuring

**Adopted 2 September 2026.** Marrs: *"The pull now button is not working anymore."* And: *"I'd rather the Polynize colour is our brand mint colour instead of the blue. Just swap Shourov to the blue colour and make me (Marrs) a slightly more red colour."*

### The button

A production build was run first, because a client island that throws during hydration renders from the server HTML and then never attaches its handler, which looks exactly like a dead button and is invisible to `tsc`. The build was clean, the route exists in the manifest, the middleware does **not** double-prefix the absolute path (it only rewrites a path that does not already start with `/console`), and `mcProbeGet` handles the params correctly. So nothing was broken in the way it appeared to be.

**What was wrong is that it said nothing, and on the engine page it said nothing for a long time.** One press fired a single request that walked all five brands in sequence, on somebody else's analytics API, inside a 120 second budget. A press that takes most of a minute and then reports neither a number nor an error cannot be told apart from a dead button.

**And a pull could succeed while leaving the panel empty.** The route returns `ok` when it has recorded a per-stream failure, deliberately, because one unmapped brand must not fail the other four. So five refused brands returned 200 and the button showed nothing at all. **That is the shape of bug that makes someone distrust a tool rather than report it**, and it is mine twice over: I wrote the fail-open route and then read its result badly.

It is now one request per stream, driven from the client:

- the label names the brand it is waiting on, so a slow one looks slow rather than broken;
- each request stands alone, so no single hang can eat the run's budget;
- a 90 second abort per request, because a hung fetch has no natural end;
- the outcome is printed and stays printed: how many posts, from how many streams, and every stream that failed with its reason.

The all-streams path stays on the route, because that is what a cron will want.

### The colours, and the one the validator refused

His assignment is his call and it is applied: Polynize takes the brand hue, Shourov takes blue, Marrs moves from orange to red.

**`#69fccb` itself cannot be a chart fill.** OKLCH L 0.898, far above the 0.48-0.67 band a mark has to sit in, and the validator says so as a hard FAIL. So Polynize is the same hue at L 0.65, `#00a77b`, which reads as the brand's green at 14px. The brand token is untouched and still paints the chart's own line, where a lone colour is checked for contrast rather than for series separation.

**Then the red caught a real problem, which is the whole reason the script is run rather than reasoned about.** Mint beside red is the classic red/green collapse, and these two slots **touch in every bar**, because Polynize and Marrs are adjacent in `STREAMS`:

| pair | CVD ΔE | verdict |
|---|---|---|
| stepped mint + coral `#ff7a6b` | **1.5** | effectively no distinction at all |
| stepped mint + documented red `#e66767` | 6.1 | under the target of 8 |
| stepped mint + `#e34948` | 7.2 | still under |
| stepped mint + **`#cf4436`** | **9.1** | clears it, both modes |

Twenty four combinations were measured. Coral was the first thing I reached for, being the brand's own red, and it is the worst possible choice here: a deuteranope would see Polynize and Marrs as one colour. **That is a mistake I would have shipped on taste.**

Final: `#00a77b` mint, `#cf4436` red, `#3987e5` blue, `#c98500` yellow, `#d55181` magenta on dark; the same mint and red with the documented light steps for the other three on light. Dark passes every check; light passes all but contrast, which keeps its three relief channels (a visible total per bar, named legend entries with avatars, and the table).

The rejected candidates are asserted in the tests, so a future "let us just use coral" is a failing test rather than a shipped mistake.

## D89: 67 posts were stored and the panel said nothing was published

**Adopted 2 September 2026.** Marrs pressed Pull now, watched it walk all five brands, and sent back a screenshot. The button's own receipt read **"67 posts from 3 streams"**. Two lines below it, the panel said *"Nothing published in this range"*, with Last 90 days selected.

Both were telling the truth. The posts were stored and the panel could not see their dates.

### The reader would not read its own output

The store re-normalises stored posts on the way in, deliberately, and the comment says why: *so a stored post and a fresh one can never disagree about shape*. That instinct is right and I then undid it. `normalizePost` knew Metricool's three date fields (`publicationDate.dateTime` from the brand feed, `created.dateTime` from LinkedIn's, the flat `createTime` from TikTok's) and **not the one it writes itself**, `published_at`.

So every read stripped the date off every post. `postsSince` excludes undated posts, correctly, because a range is a claim about when something happened. Sixty seven real posts with real impressions became "nothing published in this range", and **nothing anywhere looked broken**: no error, no exception, no empty store, and a button that had just reported success honestly.

**The invariant is now asserted: normalizing an already-normalized post returns it unchanged**, field by field rather than by one deep-equal, so a future loss names itself. Any reader that writes its own shape has to be able to read it back, and only a round-trip test proves that.

No re-pull is needed. The stored files always had the dates; only the read discarded them.

### One day apart, for the same reason

The pull counted back 90 days from today and the panel's widest range counted back 89, so a post exactly on the boundary was stored and outside every view of it. `pullWindow` now derives its start from `rangeStart`, the same function the ranges use. One derivation, one answer, asserted.

### And the screen he photographed was shouting

The engine page printed a full sentence per unconnected stream, so *"This stream is not mapped to a Metricool brand yet, so there is nothing to read"* appeared twice at length, once for Kristin and once for Julian, and again in shorter form beside the button. Three copies of one fact, taking more room than the numbers.

Unmapped streams are now named together in one line, *"Kristin and Julian are not connected to a Metricool brand yet"*, which needed a machine-readable `error_kind` on the store rather than matching on the wording of a message. A real failure still gets its own words, because that one is worth reading. And the button's line is now a receipt rather than a report: it counts the streams that had nothing, and the panel below carries the reason.

**The legend also stopped claiming colours nothing uses.** It listed all five streams including the two that are not connected, which reads as "they posted nothing" rather than "they are not wired up". It now lists only the streams that contributed to the bars in front of you.

## D90: Every keystroke was a save, so the row you were editing left the screen

**Adopted 2 September 2026.** Marrs, describing it exactly:

> "It is super disorienting because I'm looking at a line, and then I select the date. As soon as I select the date, it disappears and moves somewhere else because it's sorting by date and time. Also, with time, I can only select one thing at a time. If I change the number 7 to 7:00 AM, for example, and I need to change that to 12:00, as soon as I press in 1, it goes to 1:00 AM and disappears."

Both inputs saved on every `onChange`, and the board sorts by `scheduled_at`. `<input type="time">` fires a change per segment, so typing 12:00 wrote **01:00** on the way past, the list re-sorted, and the row he was editing jumped to a different day. Then the same again when he reached the 2.

**He also proposed the fix, and it is the right one:** *"maybe there's a little Set button. You select the date, you select the time, then you press Set, and then it moves it, as opposed to it recalculating every time I change one little single digit."*

### What changed

A draft per entry, held on the board and keyed by entry id, and **nothing is written until Set**. Keyed rather than kept in the row because the row is a render function inside a list that re-sorts: state living in the row would be destroyed by the very re-sort it caused.

The draft is deleted once saved, so the inputs go back to following the entry and there is only ever one answer to "what time is this post".

**Set only exists while there is something to set.** Its appearance is the signal that the row and the store disagree; its disappearance is the confirmation that they no longer do. With an empty date it reads "Clear date", because clearing is a real thing to want and it is the same gesture.

Enter commits too, since the hands are already on the keyboard.

### The trap that came with it

Once a row can hold an unsaved time, **"Schedule at set time" means the time in the store, not the one on screen.** Offering it mid-edit is offering to publish at a time he can see and did not choose, and "Add to queue" would silently discard the draft instead. So all three actions wait for Set, and their tooltips say why rather than just going grey.

One rule, worth keeping: **a row has to agree with the store before it can act.**

### Verified as an interaction, not as code

The behaviour lives in the wiring rather than in a pure function, so it was driven in a browser: the same draft/dirty/gate logic in a harness, typing 07:00 to 01:00 to 12:00. **Zero writes across the whole edit, then exactly one on Set**, with the queue button disabled throughout and the row back in sync after. That is the property that matters and it is not something a typecheck can see.

## D91: Two of April's own instructions were fighting, and one house rule had no home

**Adopted 2 September 2026.** Marrs asked a design question and gave two examples of feedback he wanted to give April. Both examples turned out to be code rather than taste, which is itself the answer to his question.

> "I want her to say 'don't' instead of 'do not' and things like that."
> "In a certain part of the system she was writing 'visual hook' and 'written hook' when it wasn't needed."

### The second one was a prompt contradicting itself

`hooksSystemPrompt` says, in its own words:

> Every hook must be ONE SPOKEN LINE, the words said to camera. **No on-screen caption line, no labels, no stage directions.**

Three lines later it appended the shared `recipeBlock`, which said:

> Label them "HOOK 1:" to "HOOK n:", **each with its own ON-SCREEN TEXT and SPOKEN lines**, separated by a line of four hyphens.

**Two instructions, one prompt, in direct opposition, and April obeyed the second.** She was not getting it wrong; she was doing as she was told by the other half of her own brief. The same block also reached the TEXT prompt, where an on-screen line is meaningless because a LinkedIn post has no screen.

**Nothing could see the disagreement, because both halves were just strings.** No type, no test and no reviewer reading either file alone would catch it: the conflict only exists once the fragments are concatenated, and nothing in the codebase assembles them outside a live request.

The hook-variants block is now opt-in, with three shapes, and it **defaults to off**. A prompt that wants it asks for it. That direction is the safe one: the old default pushed an instruction into prompts that had already said the opposite. `script` gets the two tracks, `written` gets one opening line and is told why ("this piece is read, not performed"), and everything else gets nothing.

**What was NOT changed, deliberately.** `HOOK_CRAFT` still discusses on-screen headlines in a prompt writing a text post, and that is left alone because its wording is already hedged ("where the shape ALSO asks for an ON-SCREEN TEXT line") and it explicitly warns that its examples came from a two-line format. **A description of a thing is not an order to produce it**, and that distinction is where this kind of analysis usually goes wrong. It is a candidate rather than a fault, and a prompt audit is running over every other path for the same class of bug.

### The first one needed a home before it needed a rule

There were already two standing rules of this kind and no shared place for them: the em-dash ban lives beside its stripper in `lib/em-dash.ts`, the no-markdown rule beside its stripper in `lib/plain-copy.ts`. Both are about a CHARACTER, so living next to the code that removes it is right. A rule about how the writing SOUNDS has no stripper to sit beside.

So `lib/house-voice.ts`, appended to every system prompt in the app, with the test for what belongs in it written at the top: **does this apply to every piece of writing the system produces, regardless of stream, format or screen?** If it applies to one stream it is that stream's brand voice doc. If it applies to one screen it belongs in that screen's prompt. Three scopes, and a rule in the wrong one is either ignored or applied where it does harm.

**Instructed, not enforced, and that is the difference from the em-dash.** An em-dash has no legitimate use here, so it is stripped and the instruction is belt and braces. "Do not" has two: inside a quotation, and as deliberate emphasis on an imperative. A find-and-replace would rewrite a quote, flatten the emphasis, and have to fix capitalisation to avoid producing "Don't touch" mid-sentence. So this one asks, with examples rather than adjectives, because the hook guidance already learned that a model can copy `don't` and can only approximate "be conversational".

## D92: The prompt audit, and the one thing it confirmed

**Adopted 2 September 2026.** D91 found a prompt contradicting itself **by accident**, which is the wrong way to find that class of bug. So all six of April's prompt paths were audited for it: each reader followed every fragment its prompt concatenates into the file it lives in, and every claim was then verified by a separate pass told to default to refuting.

**38 candidates, 37 refuted, one confirmed.** That ratio is the point of the verify pass: the common failure of this analysis is reading a hedged DESCRIPTION as an ORDER, and thirty seven of those were exactly that.

### The confirmed one, in the same shape as D91

`screen_record_long`'s own scriptShape:

> the script "carries no visual notes, no screen descriptions, no stage directions and **no shot marks**"

The built-in template for that same format, injected into the same prompt as the STRUCTURE:

> 'Mark **"SHOT: overhead"** on the one or two sections where the physical touch is the point'

One instruction named the exact artifact the other forbids by name. And the prompt's closing hard constraints then told April to delete the marks the recipe had just ordered, so the outcome was either shot marks in a teleprompter script or a recipe beat silently dropped, **with no way for the operator to tell which happened.**

**Nothing was lost in the fix.** Every removed line already existed, correctly placed, in the same format's `screenPromptShape`, which is what the Screen Prompt stage reads: the cumulative build and the overhead shot are both there word for word. The template simply predates D29, which split the two tracks, and its `outputs` line still promised "a two-track script". That is now what the two STAGES produce between them, not what one prompt returns.

### The one the audit missed, and why it is not being fixed yet

`touchscreen-concept-flip` carries the same stale two-track guidance and worse placed: `hook_recipe` has a labelled **"On-screen text hook:"** line, against a format whose shape says the whole script is spoken words only, "hooks and beats alike".

**It cannot simply be deleted.** `split_screen_short` has **no `screenPromptShape`**, and a `ContentTemplate` has no screen-brief field, so those lines are the only copy of that guidance anywhere. Removing them would trade a contradiction for lost editorial direction, which is the worse trade. It needs a decision, not a silent edit:

- add a `screen_recipe` field to templates (correct model: the flip's screen behaviour is template-specific, not format-wide), which touches the store, the editor and the screen-prompt path; or
- give `split_screen_short` a `screenPromptShape` and accept that the guidance generalises to every split-screen short.

**Its practical cost is smaller than it looks and worth stating precisely:** the script prompt's hard constraints already say to drop screen notes the shape did not ask for, so the likely outcome is the guidance being ignored for the script, which is the right outcome for the script. The real loss is that the prezie stage never sees it.

### The invariant is asserted, not the instance

A recipe is **data** (a stream can write its own) and a format's shape is **code**, so the two can drift again with nothing to notice. The test now holds every active library template on a spoken-only format to the rule, checking for labelled artifacts (`SHOT:`, `ON-SCREEN TEXT`) as orders rather than for the word "screen" in a description.

`touchscreen-concept-flip` is listed as a **named, explained exception** rather than quietly excluded, and there is an assertion that it still carries the stale wording, so removing it from that list fails loudly rather than silently passing.

## D93: Telling April something and having it stick

**Adopted 2 September 2026.** Marrs: *"regardless of where I am in the system, if there's a chat window, I can write `feedback..` and then give some feedback that goes directly to adjusting her function."* Then: *"I trust you to build it."*

So: any chat box, his own syntax, and the note outlives the conversation. Plus a screen where he can see what she has been told, because without that the feature is a write-only pile.

### The design is entirely about not making April worse

A prompt has a signal budget, and a growing pile of one-line notes spends it. **This codebase has learned that twice**: D26 compressed the hook library to adjectives and the writing got worse; the fix was to restore the examples and cut wordage elsewhere. So every decision below is biased toward FEW, STRONG, SCOPED notes rather than a complete record of everything ever said.

**Scope is a JOB, not a screen.** A note about hook labelling should apply wherever hooks are proposed, not on the one url he happened to be looking at. A screen is a place; a job is what April was doing, and that is what the note is about. Six jobs, each a real prompt builder: hooks, outline, script, copy, article, edit.

**It fails narrow.** An ambiguous note lands on the job in view, never on the house. A narrow note applied everywhere does damage; a global note stored narrowly needs widening once. Widening is one control on the review screen; un-damaging every piece of copy in the system is not. Saying "everywhere", "always" or "house rule" reaches the house from inside the chat box, and "for kristin" reaches a named stream.

**The scope is said out loud when the note is taken**, naming the job and how to widen it. An invisible scope choice is the same class of mistake as the YouTube title nobody could see (D82): a derived value the operator cannot check is a guess with extra steps.

**A note cannot fix a bug, so "this is a bug" is a control.** Both of his first examples proved the point: "don't instead of do not" was a missing house rule (D91), and the hook labels were a prompt contradicting itself. A note for the second would have papered over a defect and left April told two opposite things, picking one. Defects are recorded, listed separately, and **never injected**.

**The cap refuses rather than rotates.** Eight per scope. Not a newest-first window: silently retiring his oldest and most established preference to make room for today's aside is the worst possible behaviour, because the note he would most want kept is the one that has been true longest. Anything over the cap is named on the review screen. A limit that quietly drops things is a limit nobody can plan around.

**Nothing is ever deleted.** Retiring stamps a date, which removes it from every prompt and leaves it on the screen. Seeing what was said and what happened to it is most of the value.

### Where the notes reach, and where they deliberately do not

Injected by the PROSE builders only: the four in `draft.ts`, the two article paths, and the piece chat. **Not in `lib/llm`**, which wraps every model call in the app including the ones that extract JSON, plan slides, parse concepts and generate figures. A note about how a sentence should sound has no business in a JSON extractor, and the prompt audit (D92) flagged exactly that risk for the global rules that already live there.

Every read is tolerant by contract: no corrections is a weaker prompt, and a failed lookup must never cost the draft. Same rule the exemplar load already follows.

### The near-miss worth recording

The first version of the capture helper returned a ready-made response, `{ ok, feedback, reply }`, for both chat routes to send. **The two clients read different shapes.** The piece chat does:

```
if (data.content !== null && data.content !== contentRef.current) onApply(data.content)
```

An absent `content` arrives as `undefined`, `undefined !== null` is **true**, and it would have written `undefined` over his draft. **A confirmation message would have destroyed the piece he was working on.**

So the helper returns TEXT and each route builds its own reply in its own shape. The piece route sends `content: null`, which is the existing way of saying "the draft was not changed" and is exactly true. The narrative route sends the article back unchanged plus the note, because that client only acts when it sees an article and would otherwise have said "that did not work" about a note it had stored perfectly.

Worth keeping: **a shared helper that returns a Response has to know every caller's contract, and it never does.**

## D94: The analytics and scale brief, and a correction to D79

**Adopted 3 September 2026.** Marrs brought a second agent's research on Metricool autolists and asked for an independent view, plus a deep dive on click-through, attribution and scaling brands per use case. The full brief is `docs/pam-console/analytics-and-scale.md`. Three things belong in the decision log.

### D79 was wrong about the premise

D79 said Metricool has no queue: "528 paths, none of them a queue." **False.** Metricool calls it an autolist and there are 25 endpoints under `/lists/*`: create and enable a list, add and reorder posts, create and update the weekly timing rows. I searched for my own vocabulary, "queue" and "autoschedule", rather than theirs. The other agent read the product and found it.

**The console-side queue still stands, and it is now a decision rather than a mistake.** Every entry the console creates knows its frame, its Story, its lane, its slot kind, its hand-post mode and its timezone. An autolist is a FIFO with a timetable and knows none of that, and the frame ladder, the tile the whole learning loop depends on, needs the frame. So fresh content drains through our queue, where attribution lives. **Autolists are for the evergreen tier**: a proven post promoted into a circular `Repeat` list, item id stored on the entry, copy varied per cycle. That is the mechanism for "find what works and double down."

### Click-through is zero today by construction, not by audience

The auto path publishes **no link to polynize.ai at all**. The kit declares `link: 'first_comment'` on every LinkedIn text frame, the entry has a `first_comment` field, the Metricool client sends `firstCommentText`, and **nothing ever writes `first_comment`**. The link rule exists as a lint and as an instruction to April; it was never a writer. And the site discards attribution at the door: no UTM or referrer is captured anywhere in either funnel, the `sessions` insert stores `{ id, phase }`, the `leads` row stores `source: 'blueprint'`. Both halves of the join are missing, which at least means nothing has to be undone.

**Two research claims corrected against Metricool's own words.** Their shortener "doesn't track anything" (their help centre, verbatim), so it gives no click stats and would strip our UTMs; turn it off. And "Metricool does not offer UTM analytics." The only click figure they hold is LinkedIn's own `clicks` on post analytics. **Click measurement has to be ours**, first-party, with `utm_content = entry_id` as the join back to the frame and `utm_campaign = lane` as the segment the nurture brief asked for.

**Vercel Web Analytics has a public API with UTM dimensions, gated by plan:** UTM parameters are collected only on Pro with Web Analytics Plus or Enterprise, custom events need Pro, and the reporting window is one month on Hobby. Which plan the team is on is a question only Marrs can answer, and it decides whether that source exists.

### Lane is the missing axis

The console has streams (who it is for) and frames (what kind of post). It does not have lanes (which use case a post serves), and the strategy is organised around six of them. Adding `lane` to the Story, carried to every entry and written into every link, is what makes "what works for hiring managers" a query, and a lane that earns it gets its own Metricool brand. The build order is in the brief: links with the key, first-party capture, the url join, lane, the frame ladder by conversion, evergreen autolists, then the nightly pull.


## D95: The brief revised on Marrs's feedback, and the platforms read at source

**Adopted 3 September 2026.** Marrs read the analytics and scale brief and gave feedback as he went. Six things changed the document; two are corrections to me.

### The click path was already proven, by ManyChat, on day one

He set up ManyChat on TikTok and Instagram: a viewer comments "Map", a flow DMs them the lead magnet. *"I posted the first bit of content today. The lead flow worked perfectly. Someone went and used one of the lead magnets on Polynize.ai, and they booked in a meeting with me straight away."* One post, one completion, one booking. **The funnel works end to end before any of this is built.** What is missing is only that nothing recorded which post did it. So the console's job on the click is narrower and clearer than I had it: hand every post its one tagged link, on the entry and in the hand-post brief, so whichever path delivers it (his ManyChat flow, the console's first comment on LinkedIn, or a manual reply) the click carries `utm_content = entry_id`.

### The word is use case

The strategy doc says *lane*; the team says *use case*. Renamed throughout the brief and the todo. The strategy's YAML `lane_id` is the same thing.

### "Many brands" means use-case brands, and it is Phase 2

Not more channels under Marrs; channels like "Leadership Central" that carry one use case and point to Polynize. And not yet: Phase 1 is one Polynize page with six use cases tagged and a frame ladder per use case. Phase 2 opens a channel for a use case when its ladder shows a frame that converts. **The console should make opening a channel a configuration act**: a new stream mapped to a new brand, inheriting the use case's spec, voice and kit defaults.

### Partner growth changes what the CRM has to carry

The leadership meeting shifted to a partner growth strategy: marketing brings leads, partners take them by specialty (Patricia, HR, CHROs and CEOs). This is the strongest argument for use-case channels, because **the channel becomes the routing key**: a lead from the hiring channel is Patricia's before anyone reads it. And the CRM is **in scope**, his words: the lead has to carry its use case, its partner and the stage it reached, so the frame ladder can eventually rank by revenue and not only by completions. The discovery call is booked on his Google booking page, not Calendly.

### The platforms, read at source, and what that actually shows

He challenged the Sprout and Hootsuite figures: *"all the major social media platforms have changed to pretty much AI-native algorithms... straight from the horse's mouth."* So each platform's own most recent statement was read and separated from the trade press:

- **LinkedIn** is the only one that has said so in 2026: the March engineering post describes an LLM-powered ranker fed the member's ordered activity and the post's own text and format, naming "long dwells, likes, comments, shares" as positive engagement, with **no weighting disclosed and nothing on links or AI content**.
- **Instagram's** current page is from May 2023; it does say it makes "less visible reels that have already been posted on Instagram", which matters for the same-video-two-brands idea. Mosseri's 2025 to 2026 signal ordering (watch time, likes per reach, sends per reach) was reached only through trade summaries.
- **TikTok's** is from June 2020 and is explicit that completion "would receive greater weight" and that follower count is not a factor; the "followers first then a test audience" claim is not in anything TikTok has published.
- **YouTube's** is from 2021 (clicks, watchtime, survey satisfaction, shares, likes) plus a July 2026 guide on the Shorts-to-long-form link; the "formally separated algorithms" claim is not in either.
- **X's** ranker is open source and current (August 2026): a weighted sum of predicted actions including **link click** as a positive, with an out-of-network discount and a new-author boost, and no Grok in the ranking code.

**What it means:** every platform's direction is the same and it favours one-use-case channels, since rankers that read what a post is about reward accounts that are consistently about one thing. Completion, saves, shares and dwell are the currency. Instagram enforces originality, so the same file on two accounts is the one scaling move to avoid; one recording, different cuts is the safe version. **Nothing official says how often to post**, which makes cadence an output of production capacity, exactly as the strategy's section 06 has it. Four of the five official sources predate the "past month", so the honest position is: measure with the frame ladder rather than believe the headlines.

### The shortener, decided

*"Do what you think is best for the system."* Off, and the console builds every link itself. If a short spoken link is ever wanted, it is ours: a redirect on polynize.ai that expands to the tagged link, counted first-party.


## D96: Every post carries its own label, and every Story knows its use case

**Adopted 5 September 2026.** Steps 1 and 4 of the plan in `docs/pam-console/analytics-and-scale.md`, built together because the label needs the use case to be worth reading.

### What was built

**The six use cases as data** (`lib/marketing/use-case.ts`): id, label, hint, landing path, magnet, and the cue words April uses to suggest one. The ids are the Kit segment ids from the strategy and the nurture design, so a lead tagged from a link needs no translation. Named `use_case` everywhere and never `lane`, because `lane` already means the stream in this codebase.

**The link builder** (`lib/marketing/tracking-link.ts`): one function, deterministic, four labels: `utm_source` the network, `utm_medium` the delivery (`social` on the post, `dm` a ManyChat flow, `reply` pasted by hand), `utm_campaign` the use case or `none`, `utm_content` the entry id. The same file reads labels back on the site with an allowlist: lowercase tokens only, referrer hostname only, landing path only, and no label at all means null rather than an empty object. Nothing about a person can ride in on a label.

**Where it goes.** The wave and the prepare route both mint the entry id first and build the link from it; the entry stores `use_case` and `link`. On LinkedIn the kit says links live in the first comment (`wrapper.link`), so the link is also written to `first_comment`, which `publishEntry` has sent as `firstCommentText` since D42 and nothing ever filled. Never into `post_copy`: the copy is the operator's words.

**Where he sees it.** On every calendar entry: the use case, whether the link is going in the first comment, and three copy buttons (On the post, ManyChat, Your reply), each copying the link with its medium. In the hand-post brief, a "Link, for ManyChat or your reply" line on any post whose link is not already the first comment. Re-prepare rebuilds the link with the same entry id, so a use case set later reaches an existing draft.

**Where the use case is chosen.** Gate 1 shows six chips under the idea, pre-selected from the idea's words ("suggested from the idea") and one click to change; the Story header carries a select at every gate; the caption screen carries the same select next to the platforms for a storyless piece. The build route copies the Story's use case onto every piece it mints; prepare copies the piece's onto every entry.

### Decisions inside it

- **A guess is shown, never silently stored.** `guessUseCase` matches whole cue words only and returns undefined on no hit. The create route falls back to the guess when the screen sent nothing, but the Story screen shows the result and one click changes it. A wrong default confirmed by a tired click is a mislabelled fortnight, so recall is deliberately low.
- **No magnet, still a link.** The strategy's rule is "no magnet, no post". Two use cases have no magnet yet; their links land on the home page with the label intact. Refusing to prepare them would hide the gap; measuring it shows it.
- **Stamped, not re-derived.** Like `publish_mode` and `timezone`, the use case is copied onto the entry when it is made, so relabelling a Story does not rewrite what a published post was counted under.
- **The path is data, the origin is code.** A use case holds a path; `siteOrigin()` decides the host once, the same fallback `blueprintUrl` uses, so a staging build cannot bake a host into a stored link and the console on pam.polynize.ai cannot build a link to itself.
- **Renamed for the linter.** `useCaseLabel` and `useCaseFor` read as React hooks to `rules-of-hooks`; they are `labelForUseCase` and `findUseCase`.

### Not in this step

The site does not yet read the label (step 2), so a click today still lands unrecorded. The console does not yet read the numbers back (step 3). Tests: `lib/marketing/__tests__/attribution.test.ts`, 38 assertions, chained into `npm run test:marketing`.


## D97: polynize.ai remembers the label, and the lead carries its use case

**Adopted 5 September 2026.** Steps 2 and 6 of the plan in `docs/pam-console/analytics-and-scale.md`. Step 6 is built as Marrs corrected it the same morning: *"The CRM just needs to label the use case for now. It's up to us internally which partner we decide to give it to."* So: use case on the lead, no partner column.

### What was built

**On arrival.** A client component in the site's root layout (`AttributionCapture`) looks at the url once. If it carries utm labels, it asks the server to remember them and keeps a readable copy in localStorage. It renders nothing, costs one request on labelled arrivals and nothing on the rest, and does not run on console routes.

**The server keeps them in a cookie** (`lib/attribution-cookie.ts`, `POST /api/attribution`): httpOnly, thirty days, first touch wins. The route runs the reported url through the same allowlist the console's link builder uses, so a crafted url cannot put a sentence or an address into the cookie. First touch, because the question is "which post started it", and that is the first one.

**At the lead.** `captureLead` takes the cookie's contents from its two callers (the team-map save and the job-map start) and writes `utm`, and when the campaign label is one of the six use-case ids, `use_case` with confidence `utm`. Migration `0014_lead_attribution.sql` adds the three columns, nullable, plus an index on `use_case`.

**If the migration has not been applied yet, nothing breaks.** The lead write retries without the label fields and says so in the log, once, loudly: a label is worth less than the lead it labels. The CRM's reads ask for the label columns first and, if Postgres says they do not exist, remember that for the life of the process and ask for the base set. Leo's `GET /api/leads` does the same. So the site, the CRM and the sync all work before and after the SQL is pasted; only the label is missing before.

**Where he sees it.** On each CRM row, a chip with the use case, with a tooltip saying whether it came off the link or was guessed. Analytics events (`booking_click`, `blueprint_created`, `email_captured` and the rest) now carry `use_case`, `entry` and `from_network` when the visitor arrived labelled, so Vercel can answer "bookings by use case" and "completions by post" through `eventData/use_case` and `eventData/entry`. A post number and a use case, never a person.

### Decisions inside it

- **Two copies, two readers, on purpose.** The httpOnly cookie feeds the lead record and no script can read or forge it. The localStorage copy feeds analytics events only and never reaches the lead. Mixing them would let the page write the lead's source.
- **Not middleware.** The site's middleware already rewrites hosts for the console; adding a marketing concern there is how one rewrite breaks another.
- **No partner column.** Routing is a team decision made by hand for now, and partners do not use the CRM. Adding the column later is one line in a migration; adding it now would be deciding something Marrs has said is open.
- **The one thing only Marrs can do:** paste `supabase/migrations/0014_lead_attribution.sql` into the Supabase SQL editor. Everything works without it; the label lands only with it.


## D98: The console reads the numbers back

**Adopted 5 September 2026.** Step 3 of the plan in `docs/pam-console/analytics-and-scale.md`, plus the url join and the nightly pull that were steps 3 and 7 of the engineering order. This is the step that uses the three keys Marrs put into Vercel.

### What was built

**The url join** (`lib/marketing/url-join.ts`). After a post has gone out, `GET /v2/scheduler/posts` for its brand over the last 90 days (full ISO datetimes, `start`/`end`, as metricool-api.md says) returns each post with `providers[].publicUrl`. For every entry with an `external_ref` and no `public_url`, the post is found by Metricool's integer id and the url for the entry's own network is stored (X is still `twitter` there). A stored url is also the platform confirming the post exists, so a `scheduled` entry whose time has passed becomes `published`: D85's inferred "Posted" is now confirmed when the join has run. Manual entries are skipped; they never went through Metricool.

**The site pull** (`lib/marketing/vercel-analytics.ts`, `site-analytics-pull.ts`). Six questions per range, asked together, three ranges: visits by post (`by=utmContent`) and by use case (`by=utmCampaign`), `email_captured` events by `eventData/entry` and `eventData/use_case`, `booking_click` events the same way. Stored in `pam/analytics/site.json` as one window per range, so switching range on the panel is a lookup and never a call. Three failure kinds the panel can say: `unconfigured` (keys missing), `refused` (401/403), `failed`.

**Where it shows.** Three new tiles: Clicks (visits from labelled links), Leads (lead magnets completed), Bookings (discovery-call links pressed). A new block, **By use case**: our posts in the range against the site's clicks, leads and bookings, and **posts per lead**, which is Marrs's sentence made a column: *"X amount of posts a week gets us X amount of discovery calls for this particular use case."* The latest-posts table gains Clicks and Leads per row, joined through the public url. A blank is "not reported"; nothing prints as zero unless the site said zero.

**Pull now** gains a sixth step, polynize.ai, which runs the join and the site pull after the five brands. **A nightly cron** (`/api/cron/analytics-pull`, 17:10 UTC, 3:10am Sydney) does the same, authenticated exactly as the Fireflies digest.

### Decisions inside it

- **Posts are counted from our calendar, numbers from the site.** The site cannot know how many posts we made; we cannot know how many clicks they earned. Each side reports what it owns and the table puts them next to each other.
- **One window per range in the store.** Six calls a window is cheap nightly and expensive on every render; storing three windows costs three small maps and makes the range buttons instant.
- **Parallel within a window, sequential across windows.** The worst case (every call timing out) has to fit inside the route: 3 rounds of 20 seconds does; 18 in a row does not.
- **Unverified until the first real pull.** The Vercel row shapes were read from their documentation on 5 September, not from a live response, and `rowsToMap` reads the dimension by exclusion (any key that is not a metric) for that reason. The first Pull now on production is the test; the panel prints the failure kind if it is wrong.

Tests: `site-analytics.test.ts`, 29 assertions, chained into `npm run test:marketing`.


## D99: The leaderboard

**Adopted 5 September 2026.** Step 5 of the plan in `docs/pam-console/analytics-and-scale.md`: the decision screen. Marrs: *"The complexity that we're creating is driving a simple decision, which is more content, more of what content, equals more leads."*

### What was built

**Every entry knows its post type.** `frame` on the calendar entry: the kit output id the wave made it from (contrarian post, reel two of three), or the piece's format for a piece with no Story. Stamped at creation like `use_case`, `publish_mode` and `timezone`. Older entries have none and show as "Unlabelled (older posts)" rather than vanishing.

**The ladder** (`lib/marketing/frame-ladder.ts`, pure). Within one use case, or every use case together, the post types ranked with `n` printed on every rung. **Leads per post is the ranking when the site has recorded a lead in the window; median reach per post until then; the count of posts when nothing has been reported at all**, and the table says which of the three it is using. A frame that earns reach and no leads is entertainment, but a ladder with no completions anywhere would rank every frame equal, so the fallback exists and is named.

**Median, not mean**, for reach: one post that travelled makes a mean lie about the type.

**Under three posts is faded, not hidden.** A frame with two posts behind it is a rumour, not a result. Hiding it would hide what has not been tried yet, which is the other half of the decision.

**On the panel**, above the platform bars: "What to make more of", with one button per use case that has posts in the range plus "Every use case", and the table: Post type, Posts, Leads, Leads per post, Median reach. The top row is the answer.

### Decisions inside it

- **Labels come from the caller.** The pure module knows nothing about the kit or the formats; the view resolves a frame id to the kit's `postLabel`, else the format's `label`, else the id. So the ladder is testable with three fake frames and the kit can rename a post without touching it.
- **Only use cases with posts in the range are offered**, so no button leads to an empty table.
- **Same window as everything else on the panel.** The range buttons scope the ladder too, and the site's numbers come from the stored window for that range; nothing here calls out.

Tests in `site-analytics.test.ts` (now 49 assertions): ranking by each of the three metrics, the median against a runaway post, drafts and out-of-window posts off the rung, thin rows shown and marked, labels from the caller.


## D100: Winners repeat themselves

**Adopted 5 September 2026.** Step 7 of the plan in `docs/pam-console/analytics-and-scale.md`, the last one. Marrs: *"If we find one type of content that's working, we create a channel specifically for that content and double down."* The leaderboard (D99) says what is working; this is the double down.

### What was built

**"Make evergreen" on a published calendar entry.** One press puts the post on a Metricool autolist that repeats: one list per stream per network, made the first time and remembered in `pam/config/autolists.json`, named "Evergreen · Marrs · LinkedIn", that network only, repeat on, shortener off, with the same per-network tokens the scheduler needed (Reel, TikTok privacy, YouTube privacy and type) set at list level where their API keeps them. One posting time, every day, six hours after the network's first configured slot, so the fresh queue's times are never contested. The entry records `evergreen: { list_id, item_ids, added_at }` so the recycled post still joins back to its frame and use case.

**Three variants, not one.** Metricool's fair use policy names "repetitive publication of identical content" as the thing they act on, and a repeating list of one text is exactly that. April writes two rewrites in the stream's voice; the list cycles through three. If she fails, the original goes on alone and the run says so.

**Every step is a sentence, and the last step reads the list back.** Their `/lists/*` family is the old planner API: mutations are GETs with query parameters, the spec documents no request bodies, and every summary is blank. So the promotion is a sequence of probe calls (`mcProbePost` added alongside `mcProbeGet`), each reporting its status, and it finishes by reading `/lists/posts` to confirm the text landed rather than trusting a 200. The operator sees the steps under the entry. **The first press on a real post is the test**, exactly as with every other Metricool feature here; if a shape is wrong, the sentence says which call and what came back.

### Decisions inside it

- **No link in the text.** A list item is text and media only, with no first comment, and the kit puts LinkedIn links in the first comment for a measured reason. So evergreen items carry the caption's own call to action ("comment MAP") and no url. Their reach shows in the brand feed; their clicks arrive through ManyChat like everyone else's; their attribution is the use case on the entry, not a label on a link. Said here so nobody later wonders why evergreen clicks are missing from the per-post table.
- **The console never rewrites a list's timing after making it.** The time is a starting point; if Marrs moves it in Metricool's UI, that stands.
- **A deleted list is recognised and remade.** `getlist` is read before reuse; a 404 or `deleted: true` makes a new one rather than adding posts into the void.
- **A second press is a no-op** that says "Already evergreen."

Tests: the pure half (`evergreen.ts`: the quiet slot, reading list and item ids, parsing April's variants) in `site-analytics.test.ts`, now 65 assertions.


## D101: Three use cases for Polynize, none for Marrs Attacks, and the measures that matter on his board

**Adopted 8 September 2026.** Marrs came back after three days with a change of direction and two documents: the *Marrs Attacks: Split-Screen Explainer* strategic brief and its companion *Generation Rules*, both now in `docs/pam-console/` verbatim (em dashes replaced). This entry records what changed in the console because of them; D102 records the split-screen build itself.

### What Marrs decided

- **Partner-first.** He is pitching the leadership team on a partner-first strategy: marketing brings leads, partners take them by specialty. The attribution plumbing (D96 to D100) is what that needs and nothing in it was undone.
- **Three Polynize use cases, not six:** AI enablement, Talent assessment, Organisational redesign. "We need to be able to expand and contract", so the list stays a list; the other four are retired, not deleted, and anything stored with a retired id still reads back with its name.
- **The use cases are for Polynize content only.** Said twice: "the three use cases that we mentioned are for Polynize content, not for Marrs Attacks." The marrs stream is a different strategy (his own account, growth, working professionals who want to get their personal AI in order) and its pieces are never labelled with a Polynize use case. The pickers do not appear on his board; a link from his board carries `marrs_attacks` as its campaign.
- **Two corrections to the brief, his own words.** The brief says the CTA is a follow and the platform is LinkedIn-first. Marrs: "'follow' is not a CTA, that's incorrect": the CTA is a lead magnet keyword (MAP, ROLE), because the audience is "working professionals that want to get their personal AI shit together" who may buy resources now and open doors to their organisations later. And "the Marrs Attacks strategy is not even on LinkedIn... I'm focusing on Instagram for sure. LinkedIn is more the anchor for the Polynize brand." Both are noted at the top of the stored brief.
- **Pillars dropped.** I had proposed labelling his pieces with the brief's four pillars. He asked what I meant and said the content is not necessarily that; the label his own rules already define is the question's focus anchor (AI, creativity, productivity, purpose, work). Pillars are not in the console.

### What was built

**Three use cases** in `use-case.ts`, ids unchanged for the two that survived (leads and Stories already carry them), `org_design` new, four retired and still readable. `usesUseCases(stream)` and `campaignFor()` make the Polynize-only rule one function; Gate 1, the Story header, the caption screen, the create route, the wave and prepare all read it.

**The measures his brief ranks first.** The brand-summary feed carries impressions, interactions and engagement and nothing else. The per-network feeds carry what he asked for, read off Metricool's spec on 8 September: `InstagramPost.saved`, `.shares`, `.follows`, `InstagramReel.saved`, `.shares`, `.videoViews`, `TikTokPost.shareCount`, `.viewCount`, `LinkedinPost.shares`. The pull now reads those four feeds per connected network and folds them onto the summary's rows by id, then url (`enrichPosts`), never overwriting a number the summary already had. YouTube has no per-video analytics endpoint in their v2 API, so YouTube rows keep the summary's numbers. New tiles: Saves, Shares, Follows. **The leaderboard ranks by leads on Polynize boards and by saves plus shares on his**, with a toggle (leads, saves and shares, reach) so either can be read either way.

### Decisions inside it

- **Retired, not deleted**, because a use case is a label on stored things and deleting the label would make old Stories and leads illegible.
- **The stream decides the vocabulary.** One function answers "does this board use Polynize use cases"; nothing checks the stream name anywhere else.
- **Fold, never overwrite.** A per-network row can disagree with the summary about impressions; the summary wins because it is the one shape every network shares and the panel's bars are built on it.
- **Unverified until the first pull.** The per-network field names are from the spec, not from his rows. `normalizePost` reads several names for each measure for that reason, and the first Pull now after this deploy is the test.

Tests: 47 in `attribution.test.ts`, 87 in `site-analytics.test.ts` (both files now cover the new fields, the fold, and ranking by saves and shares).


## D102: The split-screen explainer as a formula, the yap, and version testing

**Adopted 8 September 2026.** Marrs: *"the pitch follows a formula, which means that we have our style guide, we smash out the formula, the pitch gets created, and it's a lot easier to execute quicker... stick to one concept, lock it down, and just pump out as much as we can."* Built to his own document, `docs/pam-console/marrs-split-screen-rules.md`, which is the source; where the code and it disagree, the code is wrong.

### What was built

**The formula is locked, in the format itself.** `split_screen_short` in `output-plan.ts` is now the split-screen explainer: the fixed cold open (HOOK A ending on why or how, the TITLE verbatim), four beats of about 33 to 36 words following the WHY structure (setup, but, therefore, so do this) or the HOW structure (the result, step one, step two, the bit nobody does), about 140 words in total, a CTA of about ten words outside the clock naming one comment keyword. Instagram first, then TikTok, YouTube, LinkedIn. A second format, `yap`, is the same question straight to camera in one take.

**The title gate.** On a split-screen piece the hooks step proposes TITLES. April is given the two shapes, the killer test ("if the viewer can answer the title themselves, kill it"), the construction rules, and the whole scored calibration set from his document as few-shots, and asked for six titles that pass plus the ones she killed with the failed test named. Every title she keeps is then run through the mechanical tests here (opens with Why or How; one sentence, cut at the full stop; no double negative; no question mark); a failure moves it to the killed list with the test named. The killed titles appear as "Killed:" lines in the concept read, so the rejections are visible without a new screen.

**The screen plan is the arc.** On a split-screen piece the arc step produces TRANSFORM (one of the seven, or "does not classify"), OBJECT, TAP 0 to TAP 5, and the four beat jobs for the agreed title's shape. It is stored in the existing outline field, read by the script as the binding arc and by the prezie one-shot as the visual brief together with the whole visual grammar (one object, five states, one change per tap, the change on the beat word). A transform that is not one of the seven is flagged under the plan, never forced.

**The checks, named back.** After a draft, `checkSplitScreenScript` names every test the script fails: beats not four, over 140 words ("if an idea cannot survive 140 words, it is not this format"), a beat over 42 or under 20 words, hook A not ending on the title's word, the CTA over sixteen words, no keyword, a forbidden keyword (JOB, TEAM, AI, YES), a plural. They are printed in amber under the draft button. The script is still returned; nothing is rewritten silently. The worked example in his document passes every check.

**The door.** On the Marrs Attacks board, one box: the idea or the question. Split-screen or yap. No Story, no gates: his format is question-driven. The idea is stored as the piece's angle and stands in for the concept in every prompt.

**The yap** is written from the split-screen's four beats as talk, opening on the title verbatim, at most 160 words, same keyword. A sibling piece joined by `sibling_of`, so "same question, different format" is a comparison the leaderboard can make.

**Version testing.** "Duplicate as version" copies a piece as the next letter (B, C...) with media and recording state cleared, joined to the original by `variant_of`. Every entry made from a version carries the letter and the leaderboard gives each version its own rung, so two walk-ons of one question sit side by side.

**Where the link lands.** A Marrs Attacks piece has no use case; its CTA keyword decides the magnet: MAP to the team map, ROLE to the job map. The link's campaign is `marrs_attacks` (D101).

### Decisions inside it

- **Locked shape, filled blanks.** The model cannot restructure the script; the section labels are fixed and the teleprompter reads them as it reads every other script. That is what makes the formula fast.
- **Spoken words only in the script, the screen in the plan.** The same two-track discipline D29 and D92 established. The screen plan lives in the outline field rather than a new one, because the outline already flows to the script and the prezie.
- **Flag, never force**, in code: every check returns names, and no check rewrites anything. His document says silent adaptation is worse than rejection.
- **The calibration set is in the prompt verbatim**, because his document says the data calibrates better than the rules and the rules are a summary of it.
- **Focus anchor and keyword as fields** (`focus_anchor`, `cta_keyword`) exist on the piece for the Marrs Attacks labels; the keyword is read off the script at prepare time when the field is empty. The anchor is not yet written by the title gate (it is shown on the option, not stored); a follow-up.
- **Unverified in production**, as his document says of its own script and visual rules. The first split-screen through the console is the test: the title gate, the plan, the checks and the prezie's six states will each show whether the prompts land.

Tests: `split-screen.test.ts`, 53 assertions, including the worked example passing every check and each named failure firing.


## D103: Gate 1 has three ways out, and ideas go to Gate 1

**Adopted 8 September 2026.** Marrs, on seeing the split-screen door on his board: *"I don't like it being bare on the narratives page like this. It doesn't feel quite right... I still see this as a narrative."*

### What changed

**The board is back to how it was.** The box added in D102 is gone. **Gate 1 now has three selections under the ideas: Split screen, Yap, Multi.** Multi is the Story as it always was. Split screen and Yap mint one piece from the idea and open its script screen, marking an inbox idea used the way a Story does. The Develop button says which way it is going.

**His scored titles as suggestions.** *"I spent a lot of time creating some examples... when I click Split Screen, underneath there should come some example questions... at every stage, we're trying to reduce the friction in that creative decision."* Choosing Split screen or Yap on his board shows the calibration set's titles, 9s and 10s first, then the 8s, one click to put one in the box. Every one is asserted to pass the mechanical title tests.

**"Create core concept" is gone from ideas.** *"That's wrong. It should say Create Narrative, and it should inject that idea directly into gate 1... The idea of core concepts is redundant and shouldn't be in anyone's flow anymore."* The button on an idea now says Create narrative and opens Gate 1 with that idea already chosen. The concept library and the intake interview still exist as screens; they are no longer on the ideas path.

### Decisions inside it

- **Same layout on every board.** On Polynize boards Split screen and Yap are shown but disabled, with the reason on the button: his rules document says the question rules must not be reused for Polynize without a separate validation run (D101). The use-case chips appear only on the Multi route, because they label Stories.
- **One entry point for an idea.** Whether it becomes a Story or a split-screen, it starts at Gate 1. That is what makes "I still see this as a narrative" true in the console.


## D104: One title at a time, the arc locked to it, the rest saved for Gate 1

**Adopted 8 September 2026.** Marrs, testing the split-screen with the "future = ikigai x AI" idea: *"I selected four hooks, and then I clicked the narrative arc section... it wrote me one narrative. The narrative isn't particularly good for any of the hooks... I only should be able to select one hook, and then the narrative is locked to that hook."*

### What changed

**Single-select on the Marrs Attacks formats.** On a split-screen or a yap the "hook" is the title and the title is the piece, so choosing a second one is starting a second piece. The chooser now replaces rather than adds. The arc button waits for exactly one title and says **"Arc for: <title>"** above the plan; the screen plan itself opens with a `TITLE:` line. A plan can no longer read as belonging to none of them.

**Save for later.** *"What I would want to do is select one hook to work on now and then have a second button, which is Save, that saves that hook."* Every title option carries it. It puts the title into the stream's ideas inbox, and **Gate 1 shows inbox ideas that are titles as their own group** ("Your saved titles") on the split-screen and yap routes, above the scored calibration titles. Recognised by shape (opens with Why or How and passes the title tests), so a title he types on his phone counts too. Choosing one at Gate 1 marks it used, as any idea is.

**The Story flow is unchanged.** Choosing several hooks on a Polynize piece still means several hooks against one body, cut into several posts (the D-series hook-variant production model). Only the two formats where the title is the piece are single-select.

### The organising question, left open

*"We're going to come up with a lot of hooks here... We'll just have to work out a way to organise those in Gate 1."* The inbox group is the first cut: a flat list, newest first, capped at sixteen. Sections (by focus anchor, by shape, by score) are the obvious next step once there are enough saved titles to need them; deciding the sections before that would be guessing.


## D105: The Hook library, the locked hook, and the archive

**Adopted 8 September 2026.** Three notes from Marrs while testing Gate 1, in order: *"let's call it the hook library on gate 1... if I've already selected a hook at gate 1, gate 2 shouldn't include multiple hooks."* *"In the hook library, there should be a separate section at the bottom: archived hooks, ones that have already been used. Once they're scheduled, we take them out of circulation."* *"The hook that we're selecting in Gate 1 for yaps and split screens is the hook and also simultaneously the question that goes on the first slide of the prezi. Once we get to the script section, the hook should be locked."*

### What changed

**The Hook library, named.** On the split-screen and yap routes Gate 1 shows three groups under one heading: **Your hooks** (inbox ideas that are titles: saved from the script screen or typed as a title), **Scored hooks** (the calibration set, minus any already in the inbox), and **Archived hooks** at the bottom, faded and struck through, with the date they were used.

**The library is the inbox.** A hook is an inbox idea whose text is a title. Choosing a scored hook creates its inbox entry the first time, so every hook that has ever been chosen can be archived the same way. Active means no `used_at`; archived means `used_at` is set.

**Locked at Gate 1.** When what comes through the door is already a title, it becomes the piece's one hook, names the piece, and `hook_locked` is set. The script screen then proposes nothing: stage one reads "Locked at Gate 1: <hook>. This is the title, and the question on the prezie's first slide." The arc and the script follow from it, and the prezie one-shot is told the exact title that tap 0 carries. A rough idea that is not yet a title still gets the title step, as before.

**Archived on schedule, not on start.** The door no longer marks a hook used when a piece is created. `shipEntry`, the one dispatch every schedule and hand-over goes through, archives the hook after a post from a Marrs Attacks piece ships. An abandoned piece gives its hook back.

### Decisions inside it

- **Recognised by shape, not by a flag.** A hook is anything that opens with Why or How and passes the mechanical tests, so a title typed on his phone into ideas is in the library without ceremony.
- **Best effort bookkeeping.** Archiving runs after the post has shipped and can never fail the post.
- **Scored hooks that are chosen become his.** They move from the scored group to Your hooks (and later to Archived), so the scored list slowly empties as he uses it, which is the point of it.


## D106: The arc is the point of the piece, not the screen

**Adopted 8 September 2026.** Marrs, on his first arc for "Why AI won't make your kids stupid": *"At the moment, what is being generated is not the narrative arc. It's actually the entire design for the prezi... the narrative it's given me is some kind of bicep curl thing. There's too much text here... The narrative arc is just: what's the point of this piece?"*

### What changed

**The arc is two short moves.** Press Propose an arc and, on a split-screen or a yap, April offers **three directions**: where the locked hook could go, one line each, why it fits, and the one object that could carry it on screen. Take one, and it is developed into **the beats**: TITLE, DIRECTION, OBJECT, then BEAT 1 to 4 with what each argues and what it stands on, a blank line between every part. Nothing about taps or transforms. The prezie decides the screen later, from the script and the arc, and is told to choose the transform and design the six states itself.

**"Any ideas or direction?"** A box above the arc button, on every piece. What he types steers the directions and the developed arc (and, on a Story piece, the arc). Empty, the button just says Propose an arc.

**The locked hook is just the hook.** Stage one now reads "1. The hook" and the hook in large type. The sentence explaining the lock is gone: *"We're always going for minimal distraction here."*

### Decisions inside it

- **Directions differ in substance, not wording.** The prompt asks for a different reason, stake or person each time, all built on the title and nothing else. Three, always.
- **The screen leaves the arc.** D102 put TRANSFORM and the six TAP states in the arc; that made the arc unreadable and made the prezie's job twice. The visual grammar still reaches the prezie builder, now with the arc rather than a finished plan, so it does the design.
- **The check follows.** The arc is checked for the title matching the locked hook, a direction, an object and four beats. The old screen-plan checks stay in the module for the prezie step to use later; nothing in the arc path calls them.


## D107: A little cross on a caught idea

**Adopted 8 September 2026.** Marrs: *"This section in Gate 1 has previous ideas 'caught' and then the date... I just need a little cross in the corner of those, just so I can delete them if I don't want them there, because some are a bit stale."*

Each caught idea at Gate 1, and each hook under Your hooks, carries a small cross in its corner. It deletes the idea from the inbox through the existing delete route; the row disappears at once and comes back with a message if the server refused. Scored hooks and archived hooks have no cross: the scored set is the calibration data, and the archive is the record.


## D108: Five fixes from a day of testing, and the #content ping

**Adopted 8 September 2026.** Marrs, after running the first split-screens through: five things in one message.

### The split-screen prezie is a template, not a free build

*"These ones have a formula to follow unlike the past ones we did... First page is the title and the object, then the object goes through a simple but effective transformation that follows the script narrative... A simple animation to the object as it goes through the twists and turns of the narrative. It's more abstract than anything, starting with text and ending with a CTA text if requested."*

The one-shot builder has a second system prompt for the split-screen format: **one figure, five taps, one object.** State 0 is the locked title and the object at rest. Taps 1 to 4 follow beats 1 to 4 and change the object's state with CSS transitions (the tap classes the engine already accumulates), the transform for beat 2 chosen from the seven. Tap 5 is the CTA keyword. No text except state 0 and tap 5. The builder is given the title, the arc (with its OBJECT line) and the script. The free build for every other format is untouched.

### No media library on the split-screen or yap script screen

*"There is no need for the media library to appear in the script section."* Hidden for the two Marrs Attacks formats; the recording is attached on the caption screen. Other video pieces keep it.

### Soul stays in the media library

*"That sole model is really only good for creating the sole ID and not other images... it should just be available in the Image Library for that specific task."* A `POST_IMAGE_MODELS` list (everything but Soul) now feeds the Story hero picker, the hero route's default and the slide renderer. The media library's Generate tab keeps the full list, because that is where a Soul ID is made.

### The calendar list is inverted

*"When I add something from a post and I get taken to the calendar screen, the posts that are unscheduled and that I need to work on are at the top. If I scroll down it says Today and if I scroll down it's got past dates."* Unscheduled first, then what is coming (latest first, down to tomorrow), the today line, today, then the past (yesterday first, dimmed). No collapsing needed.

### The #content ping

*"A channel in our Slack that pings everyone when something goes live... Whenever a Polynize piece gets published or something on one of our LinkedIn channels gets published... That's pretty much just for LinkedIn and YouTube."*

**When:** the moment the url join reads a post's public url back from Metricool (D98), which is the platform confirming it is live. Once per post (`announced_at`). **Which:** anything on the Polynize brand, and anything on LinkedIn or YouTube on any stream. Marrs Attacks posts on Instagram and TikTok are left out. **How:** a Slack incoming webhook for #content, its url in the console's environment as `SLACK_CONTENT_WEBHOOK`. The message names the post, the network and the brand, and ends with the link to share.

**The one thing only Marrs can do:** in Slack, Apps → Incoming Webhooks → Add to Slack → choose #content → copy the webhook url → into the console project's Vercel environment as `SLACK_CONTENT_WEBHOOK` → redeploy. Until then nothing pings and nothing else changes.

**Not covered yet:** hand-posted LinkedIn posts (his own profile) never get a public url from Metricool, so they do not ping. A "mark published with link" on a hand-posted entry would close that; noted in the todo.


## D109: An idea in flight belongs to Gate 1, and the split-screen from a Story

**Adopted 9 September 2026.** Two things from Marrs.

### An unfinished idea shows only at Gate 1

*"If I have an unfinished idea, it's showing up in Gate 1 as well as in the idea section on the dashboard. I don't think it should show up in the idea section. Just keep it to Gate 1."*

When a hook from the Hook library becomes a piece, its inbox entry now points at that piece (`piece_ref`). The dashboard's ideas panel hides an idea with a piece in flight; Gate 1 shows it, marked "in progress". Deleting the piece clears the pointer and the idea comes back. Shipping a post from it archives it (D105). So an idea has four states, each in one place: a note (dashboard and Gate 1), in progress (Gate 1 only), archived (Gate 1's archive), deleted.

### Yes, the split-screen is reachable from Multi

*"Is the split screen option available in the multi option? If I choose a hook, choose multi, and create the article, can I then go back and, through that flow, select split screen?"*

Yes. A Story's **shorts master** (the Reels and Shorts rows at Gate 3) has always become a `split_screen_short` piece, and on his board that piece now runs the formula: the title gate proposes titles from the article, the arc, the script, the template prezie. Choose Multi, write the article, tick the shorts row, and the split-screen is one of the pieces the Story produces, with the article as its material. The yap is then one press from that split-screen.

**And the new one supersedes the old, on his board.** Marrs: *"the version of split screen we're creating now supersedes the previous one we were creating. This one's more focused, and this is the split screen we need to create."* The Polynize boards are a different case: his rules document says the question rules must not be reused for Polynize without a validation run, so **the old three-hook, one-body shape is kept whole as `split_screen_free`**, and a Story's shorts master becomes that on a Polynize board. A Polynize piece already carrying the `split_screen_short` id from before D102 reads the old shape too. One function, `isMarrsAttacksPiece`, decides: the format AND his stream.

### Decisions inside it

- **Two formats, not a flag.** The Polynize shape and his formula have different prompts, different checks and a different prezie; a single format switching on the stream would have been the same thing written twice inside one definition.
- **The kit row still says "your 3 hooks, one body"** on every board, including his where it is now one title and four beats. The kit's rows are shared; wording them per board is a small follow-up, noted in the todo.


## D110: His own arc, the draft that could not draft, and the kit row on his board

**Adopted 9 September 2026.**

### "Use mine as the arc"

Marrs: *"if I have an idea for a narrative arc, there's no way for me to input that narrative arc and for April to use my proposed narrative arc to write the script."* The "Any ideas or direction?" box now has a second button beside Propose an arc when it has text: **Use mine as the arc**. What he typed becomes the direction and April develops it into the four beats, honouring it, instead of proposing three of her own. The developed arc lands in the editable arc box as before, and the script is written from it.

### "Could not draft a script"

Two causes, both fixed. The draft was fired the instant the button was pressed while autosave waits a second, so an arc typed and drafted inside that second was drafted from the arc before it; the script screen now saves before it drafts, the same race D81 fixed for the platform toggles. And the draft route allowed sixty seconds while a thinking model reasoned over a long shape plus an arc; it now allows 120, and a split-screen or yap asks for half the token ceiling, because its output is under 200 words and the ceiling was for the reasoning. When the platform still cuts a request off, the screen now says so with the status rather than "Could not draft the script".

### The kit row on his board

*"Fix the kit row wording on my board too."* On his board the Reels and Shorts rows' sub line reads **the split-screen explainer: one title, four beats, the timer**, and the reels series collapses to one output so the wave plans one post, not three cuts of one body. The row labels themselves stay as they were, because D54's rule (one name across Gate 3, Gate 4 and Gate 5) is asserted by the tests and a relabel broke four of them on the first attempt. Polynize boards keep "your 3 hooks, one body" and the three.


## D111: "Done" must be true, and a split-screen can become a Story

**Adopted 9 September 2026.**

### The Gate 2 chat that said done and changed nothing

Marrs: *"I've tried to use the chat window for her to rewrite it. She says it's done, but she hasn't changed anything."* His instruction was "rewrite this in my conversational tone". Two things were wrong. The editor prompt told April "change NOTHING the instruction does not require... an unasked-for improvement is a failure", at a cool temperature, so a whole-voice instruction read to her as a request to change nothing, and she returned the article as it was. And the screen said "Done. The article is updated." whenever any article came back, including an identical one.

Now: the prompt says an instruction about tone, voice or wording applies to every sentence, and that returning the article unchanged is a failure. The route compares before and after by paragraph; an unchanged article comes back as **"April returned the article unchanged"** with what to do (name the paragraph or the words, or paste a line the way you would say it), and, when the stream has no voice document, says so, because "my tone" has nothing to point at without one. A changed article says **"Done. N paragraphs changed."**

### A split-screen can become a Multi

*"If I create a split screen and take that all the way through to the end, can I then repurpose that split screen as a multi? Does that flow exist?"* It did not; it does now. **Make a narrative from this** on a split-screen creates a Story at Gate 2 on his board with the hook, the arc and the script as its idea, so the article is drafted from what the video already argued. The split-screen itself is attached to the Story as its shorts piece, so ticking the shorts row at Gate 3 reuses it rather than minting a second one. The button reads "Open its narrative" once one exists.

Both directions now exist: Multi to split-screen through the shorts row (D109), and split-screen to Multi through this button.

### One way to write it

Marrs: *"if I put in my own narrative arc, which button am I supposed to press: Write the script or Draft from the concept?"* They did the same thing, and a split-screen has no concept. The toolbar's Draft from the concept is gone on his two formats; stage three's **Write the script** is the one button. The order is: type the arc, press **Use mine as the arc**, then **Write the script**.


## D112: The intro is fixed and the hook is the title

**Adopted 9 September 2026.** Marrs, on a drafted script: *"she just needs to leave the 'why' at the end of the hook because the title is the actual hook... Hook A is actually the intro. Intro is in under 60 seconds I'm going to explain to you... Hook: Why you're not late to learn AI."*

The script's first two sections are now **INTRO** and **HOOK**. The intro is one fixed line, "In under 60 seconds I'm going to explain to you", and it stops there. The hook is the agreed title, word for word, and it is the hook that opens with Why or How. April is told exactly that; the check flags an intro that carries a why or how, or that is not the fixed line; scripts written with the old HOOK A and TITLE labels still read.

His rules document calls these hook A and hook B and has hook A end on the why. His correction on the page wins; the document's naming is noted here as superseded on this point.


## D113: The prezie page, after the first real split-screen board

**Adopted 9 September 2026.** Marrs, with two screenshots.

**The title on state 0** had lost the house type: white sans, smallish, left, where the earlier boards had the big uppercase cream display, centred. The template prompt now names the style: Space Grotesk 700, uppercase, cream, centred in the upper third, one or two lines, and the title whole, because the second screenshot's board had dropped "Why you're" from it.

**The example text is gone** from "Talk about figure N" and from "The angle you gave this piece". *"There's no need for example text there. It's just making everything a bit cluttered."*

**"Build a new version" went back to the old builder.** The page had two builders: the one-shot (which, on his pieces, is the template) and the older scene builder behind the Build button, which made a three-card board. On a split-screen on his board, Build a new version now runs the template with the "what to change" box as direction, so every version of a split-screen is one object with five taps. *"I need a better way to get a prezie that works"*: the loop is now build, read it on the touchscreen preview, type what to change, build again; and "Change figure 1" for a smaller fix.

## D114: Two boards for Marrs, one of them his alone

**Adopted 10 September 2026.** Marrs, after the leadership meeting on benchmarks and partners: *"there's actually a clean split between Polynize and Marrs Attacks content and I have to start treating them as such... I need to build my own brand separately from Polynize... two profiles for Marrs in the console: the current one, where we consider Marrs a co-founder; another one, which is just me. It uses the same flow, architecture, and infrastructure. It's only visible to me, no one else."*

**The shape now.**

| Board | Who sees it | Channels | Formats | Labels |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Marrs** (co-founder) | the team | his LinkedIn, hand-posted as before (D41) | the ordinary kit | the three Polynize use cases |
| **Marrs Attacks** (`marrsattacks`) | Marrs only | Instagram, TikTok, YouTube | the split-screen explainer, the yap, the hook library, the template prezie | none, ever (D101) |

Both post through the same Metricool brand (*"Just Marrs and Marrs Attacks go to the same brand account in Metricool... I can sort that out organically when I post stuff"*). The Marrs Attacks card keeps the photo that was on the Marrs card (*"That's actually the Marrs Attacks image"*); the co-founder card painted the mint mark for an afternoon and then took the second photo he sent (`marrs-cofounder.jpeg`).

**Why a board in this console and not a separate build.** The audience never sees the engine. It sees the account, the voice and where the CTA lands, and all three are separable inside the console: a stream of its own, a voice doc of its own, and keyword destinations that will point at marrsattacks.world once that site exists (a separate repo). Everything the formula needs (D102 to D113) was already built here and none of it was tied to Polynize except the two keyword destinations. Building the content side anywhere else would have meant a second scheduler, prezie builder, hook library and analytics pull.

### What changed in the code

- **A sixth stream**, `marrsattacks`, label "Marrs Attacks", kind person, second in the list so the card sits beside his other one. `MARRS_ATTACKS_STREAM` in `use-case.ts` is now this id, which is the one switch every Marrs Attacks rule reads (`usesUseCases`, `campaignFor`, `isMarrsAttacksPiece`, the kit's explainer row, Gate 1's three doors, the split-screen door route). The marrs stream is therefore a Polynize-content board again: use cases apply, the ordinary kit applies.
- **A private board.** `PRIVATE_STREAMS` in `streams.ts` names the one address that sees it; `canSeeStream` and `visibleStreams` read it. The front page draws no card and no analytics slice for anyone else, the board and its setup pages redirect home, Gate 1 refuses the stream, the ideas and split-screen routes refuse, and the Pull button only walks the boards the viewer can see. The Leads page shows no CRM card for it (it takes no meeting contacts). Not a permission system: one list, one board, five people.
- **The Studio is his.** `canUseStudio`: the Studio button is drawn for Marrs only and the page sends anyone else home. *"No one else is using the Studio and the video flows. It's just me."*
- **Video rows on the other boards are blocked, not removed.** *"Split screens... they'll only ever be on Marrs Attacks, Marrs, and the Polynize account. The other users wouldn't do split screens."* `VIDEO_STREAMS` names the three; the kit's `laneBlocked` greys the shorts and long-form rows on every other board with the reason on the row, and `defaultTicks` never ticks them. The rows stay in the list because D54 says the vocabulary does not change by board.
- **The colour slot is a named fact.** `streamSlot` read the stream's position in the list, so inserting a card second would have repainted Shourov, Kristin and Julian. Each stream now owns its number; Marrs Attacks takes a sixth slot, a violet, seen only by him.
- **Bring them across, once.** The week's split-screens, yaps, their calendar drafts, the hook library and any Story cut from a split-screen were filed under marrs. The Marrs Attacks board shows how many are waiting and one button moves exactly that set (`stream/[stream]/adopt`), copying the voice doc and the Metricool mapping if the new board has none. Idempotent; the panel disappears once nothing is left.

### Decisions inside it

- **Moved by format, not by hand.** A piece moves because it is a split-screen or a yap, an idea because it is a hook or points at a moved piece, a Story because it owns a moved piece. His LinkedIn narratives and ordinary ideas do not move. Nothing is deleted.
- **Copied, never overwritten.** The voice doc and the brand mapping are copied only into an empty slot, so a second run cannot undo an edit he has made since.
- **Private means absent, not forbidden.** A teammate who types the url is sent to the front page, not shown a wall. There is nothing to explain to someone the board is not for.
- **The old constant is recorded.** Until this decision `MARRS_ATTACKS_STREAM` was `'marrs'`; anything stored with `utm_campaign=marrs_attacks` from that week is still his and still reads back.

Tests: gate4 gains the private-board, Studio, video-row and slot assertions (all four marketing files still 0 failed).

## D115: The Polynize Content Library of Core Learnings

**Adopted 10 September 2026.** The leadership meeting of 9 September (Shourov, Marrs, Kristin) landed on it in one exchange. Shourov: *"we've talked before about taking learnings from meetings and we've now got the engine to create content from that."* Marrs: *"you have a core learning and then you create these assets around it to communicate that to the market... if we can start collecting these in the console, the engine's already there, we just have to work out where it goes."* Kristin: *"a content library of core learnings."* Marrs, naming it: *"The Polynize content library of Core Learnings."*

Marrs to me, the next day: *"we promote the core learnings module just above the narratives module... you click 'Learnings' to give us the learning. We all work with voice, so the input would be just a voice dump or a transcript... 'Tell us what the insight is' or 'Paste the text about the insight'. Then April turns it into a first pass as a full article. You can edit that. Once you commit that to an article, the article goes directly to polynize.ai/library... just like we have a media library, we should also have a learnings library... We're moving towards collecting these to be the atoms that we use to make our full partner enablement console."*

### The shape

| Where | What |
|---|---|
| Front page, **Learnings library** button | Every learning the company has collected: title, the insight in a sentence, who brought it, live or draft, how many Stories were made from it. **+ Add a learning.** |
| Polynize board, **Learnings** module above Narratives | The newest few, the same button, the library one click on. Polynize board only: a learning is Polynize content. |
| **Add a learning** | One box, two modes: *Tell us what the insight is* (a spoken dump) or *Paste the text about the insight* (notes, a transcript). One optional line for where it came from, which stays internal. Optional use case. **April, write the first pass.** |
| **The learning** | The article with April beside it, exactly Gate 2's shape: edit the text, or one instruction at a time. Under it: the learning in one sentence, where it came from, the image for the public page (make four, or pick from the Polynize library). Two doors out: **Publish to polynize.ai/library**, and **Make a Story from this** on a chosen board. |
| **polynize.ai/library** | Public. Every published learning, newest first. |
| **polynize.ai/library/{slug}** | Public. The article, its image, the insight as the lede, and one thing to do next: the use case's magnet. |

**A Story made from a learning** opens at Gate 2 with the article already in place (no bare-idea draft), carries the learning's use case, and remembers the learning. **Every post cut from it links to the learning's page** rather than straight to a booking page: the wave and the prepare route both read `learning_slug`. The funnel is now post, article page, magnet, lead, and the attribution cookie set on the way in (D97) is what the lead is joined to. The library page is also what a delivery partner will be pointed at when enablement packs exist; that is a separate build.

### Decisions inside it

- **Recycled the flow, not the storage.** The concept bank was per person (`pam/concept-bank/{email}`), which is why Shourov's concepts were only Shourov's. A learning is the company's the moment it is written, so `learning-store.ts` keeps one shared prefix and `added_by` names the person. The concept screens are untouched and still reachable by url (D45 demoted them; nothing links to them since D48); they are now superseded and listed for retirement in the audit.
- **No pull from Fireflies.** Marrs: *"We won't do the 'Get transcript from Fireflies.' That's a security breach."* The two inputs are the person and the paste. *"The flow is what collects the data. You don't have to build it to collect it from a specific source. We'll bring it ourselves."*
- **Names stay out, by prompt and by design.** April is told never to name a client, a company or a person from the source. `source` and `raw` are internal fields; the public page and the public list never read them. A cleared case study is a hand edit.
- **The article convention is the Story's.** First line is the title, plain text, no markdown. So the reviser, the honesty rule (*"Done. N paragraphs changed"* or *"Nothing changed"*, D111) and the headline helper are the same code.
- **Longer than a Story's article on purpose.** 450 to 700 words: this is the long form everything is cut from, published as a page, not a LinkedIn post (Marrs in the meeting: *"a 600 word article"*). A Story cut from it can ask April to shorten.
- **Library, not learnings, in public.** *"Publicly, library sounds a bit better than learnings."* The internal screen says Learnings; the address says library.
- **Deferred on his word.** *"Don't worry about those new kit rows of how-to and interactive experience... We have enough variation in the kit already."* The how-to is a step-by-step article; both wait until the library has run.
- **Publishing is a flag, not a copy.** The public page reads the stored article, so an edit after publishing is live on the next request, and taking it down is clearing one field.

Tests: `learnings.test.ts` (34): the slug, the parse of April's first pass, the record shape, and that a card never carries the internal fields. Added to `test:marketing`.

## D116: One word, Narrative, and the templates card hidden

**Adopted 10 September 2026.** The audit (`docs/pam-console/console-audit-2026-09.md` §1 and §3) put two decisions to Marrs. Both answered in one line: *"I prefer Narrative over Story, and hide the templates card."*

**Narrative is the word.** The board already said Narratives and + New narrative; Gate 1's third door said Multi; the copy elsewhere said Story. Every user-facing string now says narrative: the Gate 1 door, the learning screen's "Make a narrative from this", the counts in the library, the voice card, the errors the routes return. The documents keep the word Story where it was said at the time (D40 to D115 are records); this one and everything after it say narrative. Internal identifiers (`story_ids`, the `/story` route) are not user-facing and stay.

**The Content templates card is gone from the board's setup.** Nothing in the five gates reads content templates; only the retired concept flow did. The templates screen still answers at its url with its data, so nothing was deleted; the board stops loading and showing it. It goes with the concept flow in the clean-up commit.
