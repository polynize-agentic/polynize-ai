/**
 * REAL NUMBERS, NORMALISED (D86). The pure half of the analytics build: the shape a post's metrics
 * take once they are ours, and every summary the panel draws from them.
 *
 * Marrs: "Can we focus on the analytics dashboards now? I'd love to get those up and running."
 *
 * WHY ONE ENDPOINT AND NOT FIVE. `/v2/analytics/brand-summary/posts` returns every post on a brand
 * across every network in one call, each with its text, its url, its publication date, its type and
 * a normalised metric block. The four per-network endpoints carry more fields (LinkedIn's clicks,
 * Instagram's saves and follows, Reels' watch time and skip rate) and they carry them in four
 * different shapes. Starting with the one cross-network feed means the panel is real today off a
 * single proven call, and the richer per-network fields are an addition rather than a rewrite.
 *
 * WHAT THIS DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO: invent a number. A metric the feed did not carry is absent
 * here rather than zero, and every consumer is written to say "no data yet" rather than to print a
 * zero, because **a zero is a claim**. That was already the rule for the mock panel; it matters more
 * now that some tiles are real and some are not, since the mixture is exactly where a false zero
 * would be believed.
 *
 * PURE, so the arithmetic is asserted in tests rather than trusted, and so the panel (a server
 * component) can import it without dragging a store or the API client with it.
