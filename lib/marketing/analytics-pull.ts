/**
 * THE PULL (D86): ask Metricool for a brand's posts and write them down.
 *
 * ONE ENDPOINT, `/v2/analytics/brand-summary/posts`, which returns every post on the brand across
 * every network with its text, url, date, type and a normalised metric block. Proven against his
 * account on 2 September 2026: 31 posts over 90 days on the Marrs brand, including ones he posted by
 * hand, which is the part that makes it worth having (D41 made his personal LinkedIn manual, and
 * this feed enumerates it anyway).
 *
 * IT NEVER THROWS. A stream whose brand is unmapped, whose token is refused, or whose call times out
 * is recorded as a stored error rather than an exception, because the pull runs over five streams
 * and one bad brand must not cost the other four. The panel then says what happened instead of
 * looking like a stream that has not posted.
 *
 * Server-side only.
