/**
 * THE KIT (v2): what one Narrative produces, as TYPED OUTPUTS rather than counts.
 *
 * v1 said "4 posts, one per beat". It could not say what post 2 WAS, so every post came out
 * of one piece carrying one body, and four calendar entries shipped the same text. Marrs asked
 * the question that kills that model: "Is it a contrarian post? Is it an informative post?"
 * A count cannot answer it. So each entry here names a real END STATE from
 * docs/pam-console/output-spec.md, and the frame reaches April as a different instruction.
 *
 * FOUR RULES THIS FILE ENFORCES, each one a thing that was wrong before:
 *
 * 1. ONE OUTPUT, ONE PIECE, for anything with its own words. Three LinkedIn frames are three
 *    MasterAssets, so each gets its own piece with its own body and its own image, and Gate 5's
 *    existing `missing = count - have` guard is already exact because every count is 1. The
 *    alternative (three outputs sharing one master) silently collapses to one piece and
 *    publishes the same post three times under three different labels.
 * 2. EVERY POST CARRIES AN IMAGE. `visual` is required on every artifact with no optional
 *    escape, so an output that forgets one does not compile. Marrs: "every post, even the
 *    article, has to go out with an image."
 * 3. SOURCE STRENGTH IS PART OF THE DATA. Every number is wrapped in `Sourced`, because a
 *    figure with no provenance reads identically whether it came from LinkedIn's API reference
 *    or an SEO blog. Where the output spec says NO DATA there is NO FIELD, and `doNotAssert`
 *    carries the gap forward as an instruction so the model cannot fill it either.
 * 4. THE SPEC REACHES THE WRITER. `promptFragment` is read by draft.ts. Without that, a screen
 *    naming three frames drafts three of the same post and the labels are decoration. This was
 *    the condition every reviewer put on the design, and it is not optional.
 *
 * PURE AND CLIENT-SAFE. NarrativeGates.tsx is a client component, so a VALUE import of a store
 * would drag server-only code into the browser bundle. The two store imports here are
 * type-only and erase at compile; ./safe-area is a value import and has no imports of its own.

/* ------------------------------------------------------------------ THE CATALOGUE
 *
 * Twenty two outputs, ELEVEN Gate 3 rows per lane, FIFTEEN default posts, SEVEN Gate 4 cards.
 * Order is screen order: LinkedIn, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube. Inside LinkedIn the article
 * comes first, because it is the source the text posts are cut from.
 *
 * WHY THREE TEXT POSTS AND NOT FOUR (Marrs: "maybe four is too much"). Supply: the Gate 2
 * article is 300 to 450 words, roughly ONE text post's worth of material at the 1,300 to 2,500
 * character band, so four posts is not a cut, it is a thousand words of invention. Capacity:
 * at four, a narrative's LinkedIn output is 6 posts, which at three narratives a week is 18 against
 * 14 slots.
 *
 * WHY DIFFERENT FRAMES AND NEVER THE SAME ONE TWICE. The types differ in WHICH engagement they
 * produce, not only how much: the listicle is a comment machine with ordinary ER, the hard
 * moment is the reverse. Those are different mechanisms, and the ranking behind them is
 * classifier-assigned on somebody else's audience, so you diversify precisely because the
 * numbers are not trustworthy enough to concentrate. It is also the only shape that can ever
 * learn: three frames on one idea, with the idea held constant, is a within-narrative comparison.
 *
 * WHY FOUR FRAMES ARE OFF THE SCREEN (win, challenge, recap, explainer). A row he has to decide
 * about every single week, to serve the rare week he has the material, is exactly the overload
 * he named. They stay in the vocabulary as one-tap swaps and off the default screen.
 *
 * THE POST-TYPE FIGURES quoted in `job` and `caveats` come from MagicPost, 1,141,932 posts to
 * 5 June 2026, personal profiles only, and are CLASSIFIER-ASSIGNED. They are directional only
 * and their absolute percentages are NOT comparable to any other study quoted in this file.

 * Takes the preference lookup as an argument rather than importing it, because this file is
