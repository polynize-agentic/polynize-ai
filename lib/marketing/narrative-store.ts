 * an article, a kit tick list, and master pieces as it passes each gate.
 *
 * ONE FILE PER NARRATIVE (`pam/narratives/{id}.json`), not one list file, because a narrative's
 * article is up to 40k characters of markdown: packing every narrative into one blob would
 * make each save a read-merge-write over megabytes, and two narratives being edited at once
 * would clobber each other. Per-narrative files mean the only shared write is the index.
 *
 * Server-side only. Same bucket-or-interim dispatch as idea-store and the rest of the
 * marketing config: real bucket when configured, shoot-sheet rows as the interim shim.
