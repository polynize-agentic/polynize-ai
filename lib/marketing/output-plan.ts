 */
export const HOOK_CRAFT = `HOW A HOOK WORKS IN THIS HOUSE. These are craft rules read off hooks the presenter wrote himself, so follow them as rules rather than as taste.

WHAT EVERY HOOK DOES
- IT WITHHOLDS THE PAYLOAD. Each of his hooks points at an unnamed thing: "do THIS", "missing THIS important first step", "THIS is the problem". The hook names the SHAPE of the answer and never the answer. A hook that contains the answer is not a hook, it is a summary.
- IT QUALIFIES THE AUDIENCE OUT LOUD. Two of the three open with a condition that lets the right viewer recognise themselves: "If your company is struggling to...", "If your company keeps buying...". That is what makes the wrong viewer scroll on and the right one stay.
- IT CARRIES AUTHORITY OR A GUARANTEE. "The smartest companies in the world". "I guarantee". A flat claim with nothing behind it does not survive the first second.
- IT IS SECOND PERSON, PRESENT TENSE, ABOUT THEIR COMPANY, NOW. Never about the presenter. No greeting, no "in this video", and never a question as the opening line.

HOW MANY LINES A HOOK HAS DEPENDS ON THE FORMAT, and the format's own output shape is the authority. Follow it over this section.
- Where the shape asks for a SPOKEN line only (the split-screen hero, where the first-frame text is the prezie's own title), the spoken line carries the whole job on its own: 15 to 25 words, one breath, and it must still withhold, qualify and carry authority.
- Where the shape also asks for an ON-SCREEN TEXT line, that line is the headline: 6 to 10 words, declarative, readable on mute at a glance, stating the claim or the prize. It must NOT be the spoken line reworded. Read together the two open a gap that the beats then close.
- The three verbatim examples above were written for a two-line format, so read their ON-SCREEN halves as evidence of how his headlines work, not as proof that every format has one.

THREE WAYS IN, one per hook when several are asked for. These are different ENTRY POINTS to the same argument, never rewordings of each other:
- THE ELITE ALREADY DO IT: name what the best operators do before the thing the viewer is rushing into, and withhold what "it" is.
- THE MISSING FIRST STEP: name the symptom the viewer is living with, then assert there is a step they skipped.
- THE COUNTERPRODUCTIVE ACTION: name what they are actively spending money or effort on, and say it is making the problem worse.

NEVER: a rhetorical question as the first line, "in this video", "let me tell you", a statistic with no consequence attached, or an on-screen line that just repeats the spoken one.`;

/*
 * RETIRED WITH THE DECK (D31, 2026-07-28). SCREEN_RULES, SCREEN_PROMPT_BRIEF and the

 * calls them: the Interface stage generates a SCENE as data and the engine owns the look.
 *
 * Left in place rather than deleted because the editorial guidance inside them is still

 * CUMULATIVELY instead of resetting each beat. Both belong in the scene generation prompt.
 * Folding them in is a behaviour change, so it is a separate job; delete this block then.

State what is being built: ONE self-contained HTML page (inline CSS + JS, no external assets or fonts beyond a Google Fonts link for Space Grotesk), run fullscreen on a 32in touchscreen in a dark studio, with one STATE per beat advanced by the operator's touch. No scrolling, no browser chrome, no cursor. Say how many states there are.

DESIGN SYSTEM (emit this section once, verbatim values, so the build is on-brand)
- Type: Space Grotesk 700 for everything on screen. Huge. One idea fills the frame. Uppercase for short declaratives.
- Palette: ink #0a0a0f (deepest), tactile bg #161620, raised surface #1c1c27, recessed well #0f0f17, cream text #f4ece4, mint #69fccb (the accent and the "agent/resolution" colour), coral #ff7a6b (the human/problem colour), amber #f0b86b (hybrid/tension), gold #f0e1b6 (numbers and proof).
- Depth is the house style ("tactile"): objects sit ON the surface as raised cards or are carved INTO it as recessed wells. ONE fixed light source, upper-left: a 1px top/left highlight rgba(255,255,255,0.07) inset and a 1px bottom/right shadow rgba(0,0,0,0.55) inset, plus a soft cast shadow down-right. Only three elevations exist: flat, raised, emphasised. Do not invent more.
- Motion is decisive, never soft: elements cut, snap, slide, crack, collapse, or wipe. NO crossfades, NO dissolves, no slow opacity ramps. Fast easing (120 to 260ms). Motion always carries meaning, never decoration.
- Nothing decorative: no emoji, no icon libraries, no gradients beyond the mint button gradient, no stock imagery.

OPERATOR STRIP (emit this section once)
The page renders the operator's next-gesture cue as a single short line pinned to the BOTTOM EDGE of the page, outside the composition. It must be legible to the presenter standing over the screen but effectively invisible on camera: small (about 14px), letter-spaced, uppercase, in cream at 6 to 8 percent opacity on the dark substrate, with no background panel or border. It updates per state and never animates.`;

/**
 * The two-artifact output contract. The SCRIPT is what the presenter reads on the
 * teleprompter, so it must contain nothing but beat labels and spoken words; every
 * visual instruction belongs in the SCREEN PROMPT. Both are generated in ONE pass so
 * they are coherent by construction, and share beat labels so they cannot drift.
 */
export const SCREEN_PROMPT_BRIEF = `You are writing the SCREEN PROMPT: the build brief for the animator who will code the touchscreen page, and the gesture cues that prompt the presenter through the take. It is handed to someone with no other context, so it must be complete enough to build from without asking a question.

It is built FROM THE LOCKED SCRIPT you are given. Work through that script beat by beat: for each beat label in it, design the screen moment that carries THAT spoken line. Never invent beats the script does not have, never skip one, and never reorder them. The screen is what the words are talking about.

Where the operator has given direction, that direction WINS. It is their creative intent for this piece; build it, do not water it down or substitute your own idea. Fill in only what they left open.

Open with the three sections below, then the states.

${BUILD_SYSTEM}

STATES
Then, for each beat label in the script, repeat the label EXACTLY and give these lines. Be concrete and visual on every one: a vague brief produces a weak build.
- "COMPOSITION:" what is on screen and where it sits, at what scale, in the frame. Name the arrangement (three standing pillars, one centred word, two facing blocks, a single number).
- "TYPE:" the exact words on screen, in quotes. Write "none" when the moment is purely visual: a state carrying no text at all is often stronger, especially the opening.
- "COLOUR:" which brand colour carries which element, and what that colour is doing (problem, tension, proof, resolution).
- "MATERIAL:" the depth and surface treatment for each element (flat, raised card, emphasised, carved into a recessed well), honouring the upper-left light. Texture is welcome: grain, pixelation, a rough or eroded edge, a glow.
- "MOTION:" what happens on entry and how the state resolves. Decisive movement, no crossfades, and it must mirror the meaning of the spoken line for this beat.
- "GESTURE:" the exact touch the presenter performs (single tap, drag left, pinch in, double tap), where on the screen, and what it triggers.
- "CUE:" the short operator line for the bottom strip, in quotes, telling the presenter the gesture for this state. Four words or fewer, uppercase, for example "TAP CENTRE TO SPLIT".

${SCREEN_RULES}

Recurring elements keep their colour and their material across states, so the page reads as one designed system rather than a series of unrelated slides, and the visual builds as the argument builds.

THE SHAPE, exactly, and it is LOCKED. You fill the blanks; you never restructure it.

HOOK A
In under 60 seconds I'm going to explain to you <why|how>...

TITLE
<the agreed title, word for word. It opens with the same word hook A ended on>

BEAT 1
<spoken prose, about 33 to 36 words>

BEAT 2
<spoken prose, about 33 to 36 words>

BEAT 3
<spoken prose, about 33 to 36 words>

BEAT 4
<spoken prose, about 33 to 36 words>

CTA
<about ten words, spoken after the timer has stopped: how many seconds were spare, then "Comment <KEYWORD> and I'll send you the <magnet>">

Rules that follow from that shape:
- HOOK A is fixed text and ends on the word "why" or "how", whichever the title opens with. TITLE is the agreed title verbatim; never paraphrase it.
- WHY titles follow: BEAT 1 Setup (the belief the viewer holds, stated fairly), BEAT 2 But (the turn, the only surprise), BEAT 3 Therefore (what it means for them), BEAT 4 So do this (one action they can take tonight, no purchase required).
- HOW titles follow: BEAT 1 The result (show the finished thing first), BEAT 2 step one, BEAT 3 step two, BEAT 4 The bit nobody does (the non-obvious move that makes it work).
- About 140 spoken words across the four beats. Never more. If the idea needs more, say so instead of writing a longer script.
- News is a trigger, never the subject: a news peg may enter at BEAT 1 and never appears in the TITLE.
- THE WHOLE SCRIPT IS SPOKEN WORDS ONLY. No screen notes, no captions, no stage directions, no shot marks: every line is read off a teleprompter, and the screen is planned separately from the arc (TRANSFORM, OBJECT and the six tap states).
- THE CTA names ONE comment keyword in capitals, MAP (the team bottleneck map) or ROLE (the job map). Never JOB, TEAM, AI or YES, never a plural. The CTA is a lead magnet, not a follow.
- Never use the em-dash character.`,
    screenPromptShape: `THE SCREEN FOLLOWS THE VISUAL GRAMMAR: one object, five states, one change per tap, the change on the beat word.

Build exactly those six states of that one object. No text except tap 0 (the title plus the object at rest) and tap 5 (the keyword, timer stopped); numbers allowed where a number is the point. The object must be followable as an argument with the sound off.

FRAMING, measured from the real rig: the bird's-eye camera captures the WHOLE display, so compose edge to edge. SCALE is the constraint: the display reads at roughly a quarter of a phone's height, so type is huge, strokes are heavy, and a state never carries more than one idea. The presenter's HAND enters from the RIGHT and rests over the right and lower-right of the display; keep the payoff LEFT of centre and high, and the touch target on the right where the hand already is.`,
