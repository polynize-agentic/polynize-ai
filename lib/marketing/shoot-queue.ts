/**
 * THE STUDIO SHOOT QUEUE.
 *
 * Marrs: "I want a ready-to-record cue somewhere, which may be independent of the brand streams... I can
 * get into the studio, set up the cameras, select one, put the Prezi on the screen, put the text in the
 * teleprompter on the iPad, record it, done, click OK, and go to the next one."
 *
 * Two things follow from that sentence and shape everything here.
 *
 * 1. IT IS CROSS-STREAM. A studio session is one room, not one brand. His Polynize split-screen and his
 *    Marrs piece are shot back to back, so grouping by stream would be exactly the wrong cut. The stream
 *    is still shown on every row, because it tells him which voice he is in.
 * 2. IT IS GROUPED BY FORMAT, BECAUSE FORMAT IS THE RIG. A split-screen short needs the touchscreen and
 *    two cameras; a talking-head short needs neither. So grouping by format groups by SETUP, which is
 *    what "grouped into types" actually means when you are standing in the room: set up once, shoot that
 *    row, tear down.
 *
 * Server-side only.
