/**
 * Publish-calendar persistence — Phase-1 INTERIM.
 *
 * One row per (piece x channel) = one publish unit, mirroring migration 0009's
 * `calendar_entries`. Backs onto content_shoot_sheets via an owner-scoped key
 * (`calendar/{owner}/{entryId}`) so the calendar works before 0009 is applied.
 * When 0009 lands, swap the internals here to calendar_entries; callers do not
 * change. Field names track the 0009 columns (owner_id, channel, scheduled_at,
 * status, external_ref) so the DB swap is a lift, not a remap; `post_copy` maps
 * into 0009's `variant` jsonb, and `title`/`stream` are denormalized here for a
 * fast calendar render.
 *
 * Server-side only.
