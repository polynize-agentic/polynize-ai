  bottleneck_full: `"Every investment decision needs weeks of groundwork before anyone can make a call. Each deal needs market analysis, financial modelling, legal review, and competitive assessment. Our senior analysts spend most of their time on the groundwork instead of the judgment calls that actually move the firm forward."

[Follow-up: Where exactly does it break down?]
"It's the synthesis. Different analysts do different pieces of the work in different formats, and pulling it into a single investment thesis takes another week of partner time. By the time we make a call, the window has often closed. We need the groundwork done in parallel and presented in a single voice."`,
  ideal_outcome:
    "We could move on more deals without growing the team, and partners would spend their time on judgment and client relationships instead of editing analyst memos. Investment recommendations would land in days, not weeks.",

  interpretation:
    "AJ, your investment process is shaped like analysis and judgment work, parallel research streams that feed a small set of high-stakes calls. By mapping it into capabilities, roughly 50% is structured groundwork that can run in parallel with agents, freeing your senior team for the judgment, client conversations, and final decisions that actually drive returns.",
