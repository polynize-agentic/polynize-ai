# polynize.ai — Claude Code Build Package

This is the complete handoff package for the polynize.ai v1 rebuild. Everything Claude Code needs to build the site is inside this folder.

## What to do with this

1. **Unzip this folder into the root of your new Next.js repo.** After unzipping, your repo root should contain:
   - `CLAUDE.md` (the root-level brief for Claude Code)
   - `config/cwu-shapes.json` (the 8-shape library)
   - `design_handoff/` (the full design bundle plus all docs)

2. **Move `CLAUDE.md` to repo root.** It's currently inside `design_handoff/01-CLAUDE.md`. Claude Code looks for `CLAUDE.md` at the repo root automatically, so either copy or rename it:
   ```
   cp design_handoff/01-CLAUDE.md CLAUDE.md
   ```
   Leave the original in place in `design_handoff/` too, it's fine for it to exist in both spots.

3. **Scaffold Next.js.** Run `npx create-next-app@latest` in the repo, answer the prompts (App Router: yes, TypeScript: yes, Tailwind: your call, ESLint: yes, src directory: your call, import alias: default). Claude Code can also do this inside its first session if you prefer.

4. **Open Claude Code** (the CLI, via `claude` in your terminal) in the repo folder.

5. **Paste the opening prompt** from `design_handoff/07-opening-prompt.md` as your first message. The prompt tells Claude Code what to read, in what order, and what to do before writing any code.

6. **Review its response**, answer any questions, then say "proceed."

## What Claude Code should do first

It's in `design_handoff/07-opening-prompt.md`. In short:

1. Read a specific sequence of files
2. Open the HTML prototypes in a browser and walk through them
3. Come back with: a one-paragraph summary, the four locked decisions, a proposed Phase 1 scope, and any genuine questions
4. Wait for your sign-off before writing code

## The four locked decisions

These are final, do not let Claude Code revisit them:

1. **Stack:** Next.js App Router
2. **LLM:** Minimax via OpenRouter for v1, Anthropic API as upgrade path
3. **Shape library:** All 8 CWU shapes from `config/cwu-shapes.json`
4. **Pricing:** Map from $5k, Transform from $10k, Operate from $999/mo (baseline, will refine)

## Known coming-soon items

- Refined pricing document from Marrs (baseline bands are in place, calculation logic will upgrade)
- `/console` page design (route reserved, placeholder for now)
- Real proof section data (logos, metrics, testimonial, podcast episodes)

## Good luck

Build it well.
